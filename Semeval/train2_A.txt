Q201_R26	Q201_R26_C1	Salary vs Cost of Living Doha Family with 2 kids (9 & 5 years old) - both school going Salary package of 20K (with no other benefit) Is it a good deal?	For family with 2 child; you ll probably need 2BR flat which will cost about 7000-8000 and for schooling you ll probably need 4000-5000. so it means these two will take major chunk of your salary. Further you can take 3000 monthly living expense and 2000 for conveyance. Additionally any medical requirements. Now its upto you to decide...	1
Q201_R26	Q201_R26_C2	Salary vs Cost of Living Doha Family with 2 kids (9 & 5 years old) - both school going Salary package of 20K (with no other benefit) Is it a good deal?	Aamirjaved's calculation is somewhat on the high side. I believe you should be able to get a 2BR within QR 5000 and also you can easily manage your monthly expenses within QR 2000. For the schooling; if you are an Asian; it is not that costly to my understanding. As such; my view is that if you are an Asian; grab the offer; but if you are a westerner; kick it.	1

We can't say if it's a good deal - you don't include details of the role. Try to get schooling included in the package. Agree with aamirjaved. Depends on what standard of living you want. Depending on area; you may need 10k+ for a nice 2 bed.	0

EZDAN 2 bedroom Fully Furnished you get in QR 5500; School Asian with Transportation for 2 kids 750 x2 = 1500 and QR 3000 living expense and QR 1000 miscellaneous.

I will suggest to go for unfurnished property; it will cost you around QR 4000-4800 depends on locality; Asian school with transportation for two kids 1000 X2= QR 2000; QR 2000 for living expense and QR 500 for transport; Total cost of living would be QR 8500 - 9300; You can save QR +10500; But it totally depends on your living standard.	0

Produce Atested Marriage certificate to wife sponser and ask fr a release;here as Darude said it is HR screws up;if she has acess to sponser ask her to meet the sponser and explain;definitely they will oblige and no chance of messing up;do not inform HR or Mandoop if she is aproching sponser directly as 100% they will confuse and spoil entire Broth. Choul;yes definitely ur GF will be in trouble with out NOC before 2 years	0

Because if she gets caught without the legal authorisation you could be facing a fine upto 25000 riyals. Having said that; don't be daunted the paperwork just takes a day or two and is well worth your protection and that of her prospective employers.	0

Months later they are now trying to get her back (she has 2 doctorates; several masters in her field) as no one in Qatar (or most places) would ever be able to match her qualifications.

Dr. fawaz on al waab street I absolutely would not recommend if you start getting problems after 9:30 pm; you will be referred to HMC; and if you are not registerred their it will take more time; best is to stick to HMC.

SInce you are pregnant your pelvis is expanding which causes pain in your lumbar and pelvic also due to the extra weight. Therefore the best treatment for you is chiropractic; its not only for your back pain but also for optimum health of the baby and you.The chiropractic approach to better health is to detect;reduce;and help pervent nervous system dysfunction.	0

Is it a fair treatment? Your comments please.	specially considering the kind of money we pay over there for consultancy; but not something unheard of.Never had such an experience at Al Ahli though I've gone through similar situations elsewhere.Whilst I applaud you for standing your ground; knowing me though I'd probably have waited depending on my queue waiting number.	0

Is it a fair treatment? Your comments please.	This is common problem as this hospital. I have heard of people waiting more than 1 hours for scheduled appointments. Scheduling the appointment is often difficult and disorganized also. Hopefully if enough complain they will improve; but best solution is for new private hospitals to open to create competition.	1

Doctors in hospitals here go for lunch breaks; prayer breaks etc. And since that is the case; maybe the best solution would be to schedule patients accordingly.....

Is it a fair treatment? Your comments please.	"Did you not ask for the doctor's schedule for that day? Maybe your definition of ""appointment"" is contacting/asking information desk whether this/that doctor has clinic today WITHOUT asking his/her EXACT schedule. Well; most of the doctors here are incompetent for their titles and most of the time would cause more trouble to you."	1

Is it a fair treatment? Your comments please.	Please let us know; if al ahli responds back to your suggestion form; because my experience is that they have a lousy customer service and are not interested in following up on the complaint. Do remember that all units of hamad hospital do not have a strict appointment system; you just go there early and take the token and wait for your turn. It can take half and hour to almost an hour and half to see the doctor.	1

What do you think about that?	..considering that while in Qatar;you might have to get a No Objection certificate from your present employer in Qatar to move over to any better offer. A villa might sound to be big; but; how many are to share the villa ? And who is paying for your air travel ? Shared accomodation = shared food + shared communication expenses + shared expense over sightseeing or going out. Hmmph...While everyone is entitled to his/her own views; my view is that your package is a tad low and you have to really think through to save something. Cheers	1

Then keep on doing what ever you are doing with torrents. Know by posting the topic in public forum and QL uses the portal of Qtel; then you are risking the possibilities for them blocking them. They do monitor this public web site.

Then you connect via the vpn server to the internet. they charge a monthly fee and there are many to choose from. Some give options of which country to connect to.

It could help the ports issue; but as I said earlier I have no issue with UTorrent on the normal DSL so have not moved to fibre yet. It definitely helps with the ""waving finger"" on blocked websites. You can try one of the VPNs for a month - I think prices are around $10 - I used www.overplay.net a while ago.

It's better if you use original software only....good for you; your pc...and after all for the company who spent millions in research to creat a software for you.

Less or more; piracy is everywhere. Don't say that only Indians are doing this. The software you mentioned to download audio/video stuff and books from the internet; certainly would not be from India and the stuff that is copied on Torrents (as I mentioned in an earlier thread) is also not copied by Indians only. Most of the tools to get pirated stuff online are invented in those developed countries where giant software companies are battling against piracy in underdeveloped countries. So; don't blame a particular country. Just fight against Piracy as it is illegal and not good; no matter where is it.

Q208_R20	Q208_R20_C1	What is the fastest way to download free movies from the web? 	"Torrents ... Use ""uTorrent"" as your torrents client .. Use something like ""www.mininova.org"" or any other website that has loads of torrents on it .. it is not the fastest way sometimes; but the most guaranteed free one ... Good Luck ..."	1
Q208_R20	Q208_R20_C2	What is the fastest way to download free movies from the web? 	"King is right. Utorrent (www.utorrent.com) is the best and simplest torrent client. Once downloaded you just need to install it and then use the search engine on the top right hand side of the interface to search for whatever you want to download (i.e just type the name of the movie). It will take you the mininova.org and once there it is a good idea to sort the findigs by clicking on the heading SEEDS. This will sort it so the movie or program with the highest number of seeders will show first. This guarantees you a higher speed as ""higher number of seeders = greater speed"". Hope this helps. Other good sites are: demonoid.com torrentz.com torrent.to but the one i use for movies is: www.torrentfive.com"	1
Q208_R20	Q208_R20_C3	What is the fastest way to download free movies from the web? 	And of course; it depends on your ADSL speed provided by Qtel.

Q208_R20	Q208_R20_C8	What is the fastest way to download free movies from the web? 	MFX is right; axxo movies are the best and ... Pal; the arguments about the torrents never end ... They say that the guy who uploaded the movie obtained a legal copy and purchase that and then he is free to do whatever with it; copy it or destroy it or throw it in the garbage ... So if there is someone to be questioned then it should be the one who upload it; not the people downloading the movies. One more thing; 140 Q.R for an original DVD ???

Thanks in advance Ellie x	I've been there a few times already; but always in a group of at least 4 cars. I can tell you that some of my friends keep their cars on 2WD mode most of the times. But I consider these guys very experienced as they only needed to use the 4WD mode when getting someone out of trouble. My old boss even had to drive back (in an Isuzu Trooper; mind you) from deep within the inland sea only on 2WD because the gear-box malfunctioned. So; I stand with TB that it can be done but will not risk it myself.	0

Elegance its just luck some times. Some times you get a bargain and other times you see items advertised more than their market value. Just keep on trying you will find genuine sellers who may offer cars at reasonable price. Some people are just using the Classifieds to make money by buying and selling cars.

It all depends on the contractual obligations;however; being a maid; she too deserves rest; a holiday; if not for 3 days atleast for 2 days and on mutual understanding she can come for 2 hours atleast depending on the needs. Besides all; the flexibility between both is more useful tool here; take care......	1

I'm entitled to Public Holidays and so; therefore; is my housemaid. Mine has just returned from a month holiday and is still entitled to her Public Holidays AND days off (heaven forbid!!!!).......But she's worth it because she is happy and rested!!	1

To the topic: I dont know much about the whole process; but first thing you should do is report her missing/absconding to your nearest police station and then follow their instructions.	1

Anything that would happen to her or whatever she do; it's your responsibility. If you have a copy of her passport; go to her embassy and report her. At least her country's embassy here in Qatar will be able to assist her in case she wanted to go home.	1

Dear Sukie; Did she get abused physically or mentally abused by any members of the house hold or by the neighbours. you may also contact NHRC (National Human Rights commission) and check her wherabouts. dont get me wrong; your version of the story may be right based on some evidence you may have; but there is always a but; and knowing the human right violation taking place around here that could be a place she may seek refuge there too.	0

Thanks	"Here's the content of the thread; You are probably all aware by now that there are new dress regulations in place in Qatar - the 4 and 5 star hotels were given 10 days to comply with the new rules which are that you must be ""appropriately dressed"" - no explanation of what this is but it seems to be no knees (even at night in nightclubs etc) and no shoulders. I've heard of people being refused entry to restaurants for having slits up their dresses and (in the case of a 14 year old) showing their knees. I've been told the shopping centres are also now turning people away for wearing halter necks etc (Landmark in particular). One friend just rang me to say that a group of her girlfriends were stopped from going into W last weekend - each of them had something ""inappropriate"" from cleavage; to knees to shoulders.

Thanks	What a joke - the clubs and bars were about the only place a girl could look nice and not worry about shoulders; knees and cleavage showing. No offence but anyone who could potentially be offended by short skirts or low cut tops shouldn't be in the clubs anyway. Is Qatar turning into Saudi?

They seem to want the best of both Worlds; Western trappings with Qatar conservatism. It wont work. They need to decide what they want and stick with it.	0

I do consider Qatar home and I like it; but that is because I have family and friends here and I try not to let certain things get me down. My boyfriend lives in Bahrain however and I visit him there every weekend. Bahrain is a lot more laid back; you can buy pork; get a glass of wine and a restaurant and access anything you want on the internet. It doesn't have all the oil money so the locals are a little more down to earth but it's more developed. Better restaurants and shopping malls. Most of all; you can get a penthouse apartment for 6000QAR.	1

Q212_R18	Q212_R18_C9	qatar vs bahrain anyone lived in both places? can anyone give me objective pros and cons for each? thanks.	Well I date a Saudi so I have to say he and his friends treat me very respectfully. Yes lot's of them do go to Bahrain on the weekends; but so do a lot of Qataris and Kuwatis. The place is basically crawling with people from the more conservative nations on the weekend. Besides the fact that the number of land cruisers increases and there are more people in the pubs I haven't noticed a difference. As for dress; I can dress less conservatively in Bahrain than here. There are more single women as well so I don't feel like I stand out so much. Bahrani girls don't wear the abaya as much as here and I haven't seen to many in hijab. I doubt she'll notice many stares at all. As for it becoming more conservative; well they are closing down all the bars in the 3 star hotels because that's where all the prosititutes hang out. But my guess is you won't even notice they are gone.	1

Q213_R4	Q213_R4_C1	The Mystery of Love Is it possible to love more than one person at the same time ? I mean a woman loves more than a man ; or a man loves more than a woman. ( i mean by love this thing that we all feel inside ) Anybody can define the LOVE ? I hope that i could Delivered the idea very well..	Anyone who tells u they can define love is a damn lair. Love isn't something definite and noone can tell u what it is; u can only feel it; and u feel it differently towards different people; I mean u love ur friend in a different way than ur fiancee for example. So in that aspect; yes u can love more than one person at the same time in different ways.	1

I hope that i could Delivered the idea very well..	lol apple; ur not a liar because u didn't define love; yeah it's that wonderful feeling but can u say what feeling it is ? u can't. I mean people spend years trying to write books about love and relationships but it's all nonsense because no relationship is like another; every relationship has its own dynamic and each love is unique so none of us can define love; we recognize it when we feel it but we can't define it because each one of us feels it differently.

If you want to marry a Qatari girl; you will first of all need her families approval. After that - you may apply for an approval from higher authorities. The husband isn't; under any circumstance; going to get the Qatari passport if this is accepted and approved. The children will hold the father nationality - and they will not benefit any of the privileges that locals have. Good luck and let me know if you need more information.	1

Am not sure about exchanging the licence but for the test first of all there is no parallel parking test You can go to RAYA driving school and go the police officer first with the form and all required documents and try to exchange your license if not he will sign the form for you to do the test directly. You should do this first because the school will till that you need to take 10 lessons course You will start at 5:30 with the theoretical (signs exam) they will ask not more than 5-6 signs if you answered with confidence and quickly. THE DRIVING SCHOOL HAVE A SMALL BOOKLET that has around 30 signs Then they will let you know if you pass if yes you go out to start the practical exam: 1) Is the hill test ; you have to stop in the middle (on the line painted in the street) then continue till the end of it; then reverse back to you starting point ; which means you have to reverse as L shape 2) Then you go to the parking test; you have to do it in one shot and make sure not to cross the li.....	1

Hell yeh... i have seriously to ask the sales dept. for my cut on the promotions im doing on their behalf... hey sorry if you guys are jinxed with QR; but really the crew services etc is much better than EK; coz I know for a fact that the EK crew dun give a damn bout service; they will be like yeh will get you that when i'm here next and you're like waiting. Regd you Jakarta trip; i think we fly the A300 aircraft there and those aircraft's are being converted into freighters; coz they are kinda old. LHR-DOH...cancelled... why? I'm sure there was a reason for that and you would have been compensated (not that it is any consolation) And AMM trip... well delays were a part of the airport expansion during that time...

There is no organization at all ... 5 staffs standing up in the counter; but 4 of them have no idea what to do. Keep pointing out to an arab looking guy for sorting out. Poor guy looks so streessed out trying to sort all the passengers.	0
Q217_R21	Q217_R21_C8	Qatar Airways vs Emirates Hello; I'm planning to take a long flight in a couple of months. Both QA and Emirates have flights going my way. Which is better? Which airline would you book? Thanks in advance.	Yeh I flew Joberg from Dubai like 2 years ago when we were starting there and i was upgraded to Businesss Class. But i can really tell you that QR Economy class service on these long haul flights was better than the EK J class service. Besides; they always mishandle baggage coz they have a minimum connecting time of i think 1.5 hours; so if your connecting anytime less than that; youu can rest assured; your baggage won't ride the flight you're in. So not the case with QR.	1

Which airline would you book? Thanks in advance.	The only plausible reason would be that those 4 guys were not QR staff but the Ground Handling staff and hence they must have been pointing to the QR staff. Kinda happens in most places; the handling company will always refer you to the airline... Anyways; I'm not making excuses for their lapse; but hope you have a good journey the next time you fly QR... holla me and i will ensure you get treated well... ;-)	0

Even the crew friends of mine laugh about it cos they can't really commit to what time their arrival back in Doha would be at; to catch up on a party / a movie or something. ----------------------------------------- 1200 QL Points!!!

Your friend is the complainant and not the theft; right? He should be allowed to leave and travel outside the country; but if there is a court appointment during his/her absence and failed to attend; that would be a lost point for your friend and a credit to the theft.

Can my friend leave the country or is he barred from leaving the country until they both appear in court? How can my friend find out if this is true (without trying to leave)?	Small correction here; Eng & Avid;) Your company can issue you an exit permit; but you will still be blocked by the Immigration at the airport during departure; when your name is blacklisted in the system. If you know that you had previous police case( ex. returned cheque); obtaining exit permit doesn't mean that your name is cleared from the system. You must follow up w/ the capital police after 6-months from the date you settled your case to remove the blacklisted of your name in the Immigration airport.	1

Can my friend leave the country or is he barred from leaving the country until they both appear in court? How can my friend find out if this is true (without trying to leave)?	Apple I am not arguing with you. My PRO said when they apply for exit permit it will be directed to interior ministry for endorsement. If there is anything against you; your exit permit will be rejected by the system. it is computerised and we are applying for all our immigration requirements through on-line. To clear the black listing you need to go to public procrcutor's office (NIYAMA) and settle your penalties. (near city centre) and the public procecutors office can clear your record within short time if you aooroch them with your lawyer. This is what our lawyer said.	1

Can my friend leave the country or is he barred from leaving the country until they both appear in court? How can my friend find out if this is true (without trying to leave)?	You got good points; and neither i'm not arguing w/ you. I was giving you an example of a police case(ex. returned cheques). Coz this is the common case that can happen to anyone. If your case was filed at Capital Police; you need to clear your name from there. If it was a Court case then you should go to Niyaba. Mostly; the case are to be filed from the Police dept. then forwarded to the court for settlement depends on both the plaintiff & the suspects agreement. Another example is if your bank filed a complaints against you to the capital police for not paying your debts(Car loan; Credit cards; Personal loans); then your name will be blacklist in the system till you settled your accounts. Accordingly; only after 6-months from the date of your settlement before your name is remove from the blacklist. What i'm trying to imply here is; if you know that you had previous but settled criminal or civil cases; nothing wrong to clear your name & follow up at the place where the charges agains.....	1

My Mom is coming first time in the new arrival area. she is arriving tomorrow morning..Mom can understand English...but cant talk much...She is on business class...do you think she will be able to manage herself?	go to the sales center in the arrivals terminal & talk to the sales staff there. almaha only takes bookings prior to 24 hours of the flights; how ever depending on the work load they have a chance of accepting your booking; yet you might have to pay a sum of Qr 300.00 extra to the normal service fee. i too agree with Khanan. she will be able to proceed her self if you are able of instructing her on how to. make sure you give her clear instructions. if she is a bit old; ask her to hire a porter for just Qr 20.00(porter counter is located to the left once you enter the baggage area. it will give you a porter ticket enabling her to hire a porter) which; the porter will locate the bag for her & bring her to you. if you wish to you can tip the porter with another additional amount of your choice. i dont see any point of u wasting about 500-600qr when you can get the work done just in 20qr - 30qr. all the best & wish your mom a pleasant stay in DOH!	1

Just speak to him and tell him its not tolerable since u have school going kids at home and if it continues then u would complain to the higher authorities. Good Luck!!!	1

Do i have to change name? In weddings; best father/mother have to be muslim? Thanksing in advance 4 useful info.	You shouldn't convert to Islam just because you want to marry a Muslim girl. It isn't right; at all. You should practice it and be convinced of the faith before jumping into it. Think with your brains Platao36. You are only fooling yourself.	0

Do i have to change name? In weddings; best father/mother have to be muslim? Thanksing in advance 4 useful info.	You need two male witnesses and no you dont have to change your name; and no for the last. Plato since in your previous post you said you were attending a mosque for information and phamplets about Islam; its probably a good idea to ask all these questions there as well..	1

I agree honestpedal ; especially since in most of the posts plato seems to have a lot of issues with Islam beliefs; conflicting with his beliefs. Yes i know its for your love; but hey; it must be tough. Personally i wouldnt do it; your partner should accept you for who you are and its a shame her parents beliefs/opnions are more important than yours. I guess each to their own..	0

Do i have to change name? In weddings; best father/mother have to be muslim? Thanksing in advance 4 useful info.	The reason behind most non-muslims who have converted was only to marry a Muslim girl. They know that they cannot have her any other way; unless she sins; and not all do. Yes she should accept the man for who he is and for what he believes in; but us as Muslim females - we are restricted to standards and we cannot change them. Its too complicated to discuss; but good luck. Take more time to learn Islam and maybe the faith in Allah will grow in your heart - not for HER (the girl-friend) but for Allah himself.	0

I have lived my life for a full (over 25 years) and I have met too many who have converted for being with a women. I did not point fingers at anyone - so I don't think you should be sensitive about anything that I say. In Arabic we say; ilKhair yikhis - ou ilShar yi'2im; which means ((the good is of one; the bad is generalized)). I hope that is understood. Good luck and Allah yahdi man yasha2!	0

In Islam man candivroce and women has also (but mostly twisted cultural crap take over the islamic values); but to safegaurd the process there is some time period for reconcialiation between the couple. If you can check with Sharia Court they can help you. I am sorry about the whole issue that anyone has to face such a thing. I hope it can be solved. Wish you luck	1

As with everything;good dentistry costs good money mate...but look at it as buying a good product that will last you a while but costs more vs. a crap product that won't last you very long & won't function the way it ought to but costs less...ask around with friends & colleagues;as to which of the above is better & more value for money & also about other well-known practices in the country...btw;the fact that a dentist's scehdule is full for the next 10 days is a good sign;so i don't see what you're upset about...a dentist that you can see tomorrow is obviously not seeing that many patients & isn't as popular right?...do the math mate! :)	0

Also if you use any space heater keep all drapes and linens a minimum of 3 feet away on all sides. never plug a space heater into a power strip; only directly into the wll to prevent high current draw from melting insulation and starting a fire; These things are dangerous even with proper precautions so at least read the warnings and heed them.	0

I do not know what styles are available; however the stand alone ones that look like old radiators are sealed steam heaters and you can also buy the small electric heaters in which you can physically see the coils and they blow air via a fan across the coils. Personally you should just have a warm body to curl up with. If it is too cold for one get a second and snuggle up. Skin on skin is the best way to stay warm and transfer body heat. A 3 dog night is darn cold but on that same evening a one woman night may cause perspiration.	0

Next step is to make sure the outlet is installed properly and then verify the rating on the breaker. Don't trust the wiring in the house until you pull the wall plate and check the wire size and termination. Not the best electrical work is being done in the new construction; always verify.

Yes; there are waiting lists for good nurseries and the good ones seem to finish before 3pm (correct me if I'm wrong!)

It is not like England over here. Avoid in house food too. Too many 'support staff' from third world countries that don't wash their hands. Only go with British run ones and then I would check out the number of 'cheap labor' staff they had. Look at is this way; if you were paying a lot of money for a supposed decent Nursery; you would expect the staff to be trained. Over here we don't have that. Most of them have 'degrees' from a Mickey Mouse University. They say they have degrees in Nursing; Education and Admin. Most can't speak English. Really do your research; it is crap over here with the number of third world people who say they have degrees and then don't even know what they are supposed to be talking about. They are desperate for jobs and will lie to get one. They don't care at all that your kid’s education may be hindered by them lying. Just be careful.	1

You can still get nice villas on older compounds but they don't seem to be building large gardens with new compounds...very tight. And the others are right as well -- 3bed/2bath minimum and about 15;000/month. ************************************* Be kinder than necessary; for everyone you meet is fighting some kind of battle.	1

I am most concerned about garden rather than location and I think judging by what I have found out so far location is very important on how much villas cost. My husband has been out for a trip already and says that there are really no horrible places to live in Doha at al! An older or stand alone villa sounds like the bext chance of having a garden attached. I will have a look at all the recommended websites this evening - many thanks again for all your replies	0

Q222_R16	Q222_R16_C8	Maid services Does anyone know what a fair price is for a maid 6 hours a day; three days a week? Thanks.	30QR per hour seems to be the standard charge for private arrangements for house cleaning here in Doha plus you might have to pay a transportation charge too depending where she/he is coming from - hopefully you will find someone local in Al Khor! Most cleaners here are either Philipino's; Sri Lankans or Indonesians. I have a Philli lady and she is very thorough. Speaking English reasonably well also helps! Why would you want someone 6 hrs a day 3 times a wk? Unless you also want someone for child minding. My cleaning lady does top and bottom of our 3 bed villa in 3 hours and does a good job. She comes twice a week mostly to get rid of the dust that continually seeps in from all cracks n crevices! LOL We do outsource ironing though and I do our washing! If you can find a good laundry service in Al Khor it should be quite cheap and satisfactory! Ours pick up and deliver too. Good luck in your search and hope this helps!	0

I know we have overpaid him for years but was alright with doing so. However; with that being said how no idea how much one charges per hour. He can't come anymore then he does now. Again thanks!	0

If what I have understood; the alcohol is allowed to travel from QDC to only the purchasers premises and shouldnt leave the said premises thereafter. Sharing it with anybody at the said premises is not illegal but carrying it to some other place or it being carried elsewhere when given as a gift seems isn't allowed. I would love to be told it is otherwise...:)	0
Q223_R7	Q223_R7_C7	What malt beverages does QDC carry? A friend is going to QDC on my behalf (I don't have a licence yet); and I need to tell him what to buy. The catch is that the friend I am going with is a strict wine drinker and can't recall what's on offer beer-wise. For you beer drinkers; help a brother out: what is on the beer list at QDC? I want to stock up while I've got the opportunity. Thanks!	"Yes; with a QDC license; purchase and then take directly home is the only thing allowed. If you go to your friend's home when your thirsty; maybe that is ok..... dunno I don't think anyone can buy (legally) and take to someone else's home and ""leave it there"". Seems like someone will think this is breaking the rules."	0

Q224_R33	Q224_R33_C1	Help! Talk to me about Eid... I know it's a ways off; but I would love to hear how people in Qatar celebrate the holiday. I imagine it's more fun here than in the U.S. for example; because Qatar is a Muslim country. Does anyone have special traditions to commemorate the end of Ramadan? I would like to profile some responders in a magazine I write for. Let me know asap! Thanks :)	I remember my Eid childhood. It was great. We'd first meet up at my grandfather's home. We'd all talk and the children would plan 3ayuding. We'd all go from house to house; sing a song and look cute and be given 1 riyal. After going door to door; we'd go back home and play until it was time to eat the large feast. Parents would usually chat. Families get together. People visit and they have some tea and snacks. We pray. I love Eid! __________________________ Cost of Living; Visas; Safety Info; Tips on Moving; Facts; Pictures; Videos; and more!	1

I would like to profile some responders in a magazine I write for. Let me know asap! Thanks :)	Oh Oryx; you are so right! Ramadan should be a month of less (material things) and more (spirituality). For a lot it is. Our schedules do not change much (eg. we do not eat all night which negates the point of fasting in my opinion). We break our fast at sunset with a small light meal. Then we have dinner in the evening. We get up before dawn for a small breakfast. We try to be better Muslims in this month...in the hope we can carry this on throughout the year. I do see Qatar changing from when I was a child during Ramadan. This is something to do with us; of course; and also the influx of expats. _______________________________________________________ Love is the answer...	1

Usually the night before (or earlier if you're really organised) we gather the kids around and make some biscuits and traditional sweets. These are then ready to distribute during the Eid prayer and also to the neighbours. They are also really handy when people come to visit you during Eid. What I've noticed here in Qatar is that friends and neighbours seem to visit each other a lot more on Eid than back home. I guess it's because we don't have family here; so our friends tend to become our new support structure. On the 2 Eids that I've so far spent in Qatar our 'new' tradition seems to be going to City Centre and getting some good sale items! LOL I guess that's our variation on spending the day at the park (too hot) or visiting the grandparents (too far) or staying at home (too boring).	1

My husband just went to the QDC yesterday but the bill seems to have vanished. Anyway; the cost is reasonable. The beer usually comes in cases of 24 and there is a good selection. I have heard of people making requests for specific things when they can't find them on the shelf and they have brought these in. They limit the amount you can spend to 10% of your salary.	0

This is an Islamic country; the locals don't drink. There are no longer any bars except the Rugby Club that are not attached to Hotels as far as I know. You have to show your ID card to get into lisenced premises here so not sure how it will work with a visitor visa. It is definitely illegal not only to import alcohol but also consume alcohol in any public place and also be drunk in public. Sorry if I sound unwelcoming; I really don't mean to; just not sure if you are going to be disapointed that this isn't what you expect.	0

For goodness sake; the locals do not go and sit in pubs (which is what this person was asking) and drink beer then go and watch football. It is one of the many reasons that I live here and not there.

Or is it just Bud; Heineken etc.?	Tsardoz - Talking about flavoursome beers; you can buy Franziskaner wheat beer here. Nowehere as good as Schoffer Hoffer but a good compromise considering you're in an almost dry nation. So if you're a SH fan like me; drink your fill before you come over. I remember that terrible desperation when Dan Murphy's stopped stocking this beer in Melbourne. After a brief search I found it at Vintage Liquors (Coles). You can get your share of euro lagers as mentioned by previous posters. As a true blue Aussie; I'm sure you'd understand if I said I can piss better than a Bud and won't touch Fosters with a stick. VB; Guinness and Kilkenny can be found here too. Sadly no XXXX or Carlton Cold. If you're feeling adventurous or want to slum it; try Kingfisher Strong. As an Indian I'd also recommend the regular Kingfisher (American style macro lager). Not similar to the one that can be purchased in Oz. That's made in New Zealand under license.	1

How about my opinion: Beer - 15 years Whisky - 18 years Gin - 17.5 years Vodka - 10 years Rum - 18 years Now don't ask for logic.Just for fun.	My parents started giving us beer when we were about 14. We had whiskey when were about the same age; but for a teenager it isn't really that nice. In summer it was gin and tonics; and wine too. We didn't have vodka in the house; but it's good for teens because you can mix it with juices and soft drinks. In my opinion consuming the infrequent alcoholic beverage is a much better option than giving your kids soft drinks; chips; chocolate; sweet snacks; candy and burgers on a daily basis. Obesity and its related illnesses pose a much bigger threat to public health than alcohol abuse.	1

I've been so stressed over my dog being sick that I've lost 5 pounds in 5 days... Yep counting calories and exercise works; but...what you ladies have to remember is that men lose weight faster and easier than women do. Its the estrogen in our bodies that fight the weight loss. God made it so that we would always have that extra reserve in case there was a time of starvation or deprivation; so that we could maintain our bodies to have babies...

Q227_R83	Q227_R83_C3	Drinking milk after eating prawns Drinking milk after eating prawns is harmfull or just a myth. If harmfull whats the effect?	Ayurveda has guidelines about dietary habits...like: # In the evening avoid heavy foods such as meat; fish; yoghurt; cheese; buttermilk and fromage frais. # Avoid eating between meals. Instead drink hot water; or if necessary eat ripe sweet fruit. # Avoid reheated or stale food. # Most of one's food should be cooked; as the body can more easily absorb cooked food. Raw food should be eaten only as a side dish (e. g. salad). # Make use of culinary spices. They not only make the food tasty; but support the digestive processes as well. # Include all 6 tastes in each meal: sweet; sour; salty; pungent; bitter; and astringent. The tastes also have their own influence on the subtle inner balance of the physiology. # During meals you may sip liquids such as water; juice or lassi. Do not drink a lot and avoid ice-cold drinks - they dampen down the digestive processes. # Milk should not be drunk with the main meal. It can be taken alone or with a light meal of sweet tasting foods (e.g. toast; cer.....	1

Q227_R83	Q227_R83_C5	Drinking milk after eating prawns Drinking milk after eating prawns is harmfull or just a myth. If harmfull whats the effect?	Carbohydrate rich food is not combined with acidic food items. eg if you take bread and lemon juice together; it will cause the digestive system to erratically digest both the items. Don't eat grain; cereal or pulses item with acidic items like citrus fruits; grapes; pineapple etc. Protein rich food items go well with low-carb food items like rice and vegetable. Vegetables also go well with all types of starchy; carbohydrate rich food items. Fruits should ideally be taken as a separate meal; independent of other regular meals. Milk and meat is bad combination. Never take milk and meat in a single meal. Separate intake of milk and meat by at least four hours. Milk and meat is good for body in several ways. When taken together; it becomes toxic. Many modern food styles fly on the face of this Ayurvedic food combination rule. Milk is also to be taken warm. Cold milk can cause indigestion. Taking milk too hot also is not desirable. Ending the meals with sweet dessert is not allowed in Ayur.....	1

From reading up online I'm veering towards the IXUS 860 because of its wide angle lens. 8mp is more than enough for my needs so I don't think it's worth paying the extra for the 12mp 960 which doesn't have the wide angle lens (they seem to be the only differences) thatguy - Thanks. I do plan to buy online but I wanted to try out the various models before I ordered. Carrefour only have a couple of Canon compact cameras; none of them IXUS (and they appeared to have stop stocking Canon SLRs and lenses for some reason); and the Kodak shops have a very poor selection of manufacturers. -------------------------------------------- http://tall-and-ginger.blogspot.com	0

Q229_R6	Q229_R6_C1	Why did they agree? I would love to hear from you; why after so many years Palestine has been admitted as an observing UN member. Why now? Is there a motive dodgy behind this? Does Palestine include Gaza or it is just the West Bank? I would love to hear it from you ordinary guys; not from the news; M.E. Experts; Political pundits; etc.	It is really complicated..Palestine is probably the most prominent indicator of how unjust the world is being lead by politics and power. To your point; I would say it is due to the evolution of the political scene and the behaviour of the Zionist regime which pushed it into isolation to the point where they could not get adequate votes among UN member states. Additionally; west is a bit tired of supporting the Zionist's states and cleaning up its miss so they want to have some stability..The west was a key player in creating the Zionist state but they did not have the same intention Zionist's had..My thought anyway..interesting topic :)	1

Does Palestine include Gaza or it is just the West Bank? I would love to hear it from you ordinary guys; not from the news; M.E. Experts; Political pundits; etc.	Why nearly all countries agreed was quite simple. Most believe in a homeland for the Palestinian people but not all can agree on what that should actually be. So making Palestine an observe state is a statement of intent without backing a full independence. Israel while continuing to build settlements in the West Bank is undermining the whole process and it seems obvious they want to swallow all Palestinian terrority. Shame on them.	1

Actually it includes all territories and borders that were declared in 1967 (which is actually an injust resolution; as the Zionists have no right in any inch in Palestine)	1

Yes it should have been done much earlier; however what has happened has happened; and it's best to look at it from a better now than later; and better late than never angle. I also believe that by making such a motion the UN has gained some much needed credibility as well; again not just with the people of Palestine; but with people around the world in general. Now how far would this change work in bringing about peace among the warring nations is left to be seen.	1

Experts; Political pundits; etc.	I think the world is becoming rather weary of this; apparently; irresolvable problem. This latest move is mostly symbolic; but very important and the environment of the region has changed; post Arab Spring. The global community wants a peaceful resolution and this should be two States; according to the 1967 agreement. Lets be clear; Israel is not full of Zionists (but they still seem to hold the power) and the Palestinians need to address the problem of Hamas for this to move forwards. I am optimistic about the move....	1

(even if its my fault!) lol"	for some crying is not abt weakness or wanting the other person to say sorry or give in to the situation but instead for me when i do cry/shed my tears is because i am so angry/upset that i want to say things that i am sure is gonna hurt the other person (saying out of anger) but i am trying so hard to control it as once it comes out there is no way of taking it back so to speak. so i am controlling it so hard that instead tears come flowing down; most ppl in an angry state will say things (hurtful things) in the moment of anger and when all has subsided realize that and its too late as it is already said and done with and hence hurts the other person........ my mom once told me the tooth paste story- only take the amt that you need if you were to squeeze too much of out the tube ya cant put it back in =-same goes for things said when in the heat of the moment (does more hurt than good)   life's too short so make the most of it; you only live but once.......	1

Q231_R20	Q231_R20_C9	To all auto aficianados on QL ! ! ! ! Can we have a group for autos/cars..? (I'm no expert so I dont think I should start the group)...	I agree with e46...park the car immediately. There can be several causes. If overheating; you will have a more whitish smoke mixed with steam. Do not just put water in the reservoir...you will need to use anti-freeze; but you will also need to have your thermostat checked out. If its greyish/blackish smoke; you're burning oil and you most likely have a broken head gasket or valve...both of these conditions are indicative of the worst case scenario. Also; don't forget to check your tire pressure every time you refuel.	0

"QL will lose it's basic purpose I guess. In About QL they mention ""Participation is at the heart of our web site. We believe that collectively our members have more knowledge about life in Qatar than any one person or guidebook. We want to provide a platform for them to share their knowledge and experiences and help newcomers adapt easily to life in Qatar."" Nobody shares knowledge or experiences or tries to help others in a chat room; it will just become a place for guys trying to pick up girls. There will not be any participation from all the members on any issue; people will be too busy chatting in private. That's what I personally think anyway. ""Live with passion; Die with style"""	1

Sometimes people come into your life and you know right away that they were meant to be there.to serve some sort of purpose; teach you a lesson or help figure out who you are or who you want to become. You never know who these people may be but you lock eyes with them; you know that very moment that they will affect your life in some profound way. And sometimes things happen to you at the time that may seem horrible; painful and unfair; but in reflection you realize that without overcoming those obstacles you would never realize your potential; strength; will power or heart. Everything happens for a reason. Nothing happens by chance or by means of luck. Illness; love; lost moments of true greatness and sheer stupidity all occur to test limits of your soul. Without these small tests; life would be like a smoothly paved; straight; flat road to nowhere safe and comfortable but dull and utterly pointless. The people you meet affect your life.

Q233_R9	Q233_R9_C1	CUBE!!!! Hey guys have you been to Cube ? I think its cool its just At the back of Ramada Hotel its like a Night Club ! Though i think its hard to get inside especially on thursday night i just found last night while making a detour you know the traffic! While i was driving i see this long line little did i know its a line to get inside this new club...do you think its own by Ramada Hotel? anyway its a good thing they are already permitting building clubs!	i went tuesday; i thaught it was pretty poor tbh; lots of working women and a bad philipino coversband playing rock ballards of the 80s. the design is interesting; nothing like a propper nightclub; far too bright; no disco lighting; very restrictive about upstairs couples/vip area. it reminded me of nightclubs you see in american movies-pretty synthetic and fake. i couldnt work out the booze pricing policy a Bourbon and coke cost the same price as a coke; and everyone from work had rank hangovers despite quitting at 11.30 yes its owned and staffed by ramada.	1

I went on Thursday and had a good time with some friends. I thought the band was pretty good; maybe I was hypnotized by the daisy duke shorts the singers were wearing though. Everyone that had went before me summed it up as feeling like a warehouse and it's mostly due to the white walls I think. Kinda reminded me of a high school dance in the gymnasium; buncha guys standing around leering at the girls. Hopefully after the Asian Games they will take everyone's advice and at least paint the walls and dim the lights to iimprove the atmosphere of the place. The ratio of guys to girls was about the same as everywhere else; 10 guys to 1 girl.	1

Well if thats what you want to go to the Doha night clubs for then thats your deal. Night life in Qatar hmmmm is there such a thing? From what I can tell they are full of Philipino women and old western men with a few other undesirables in. Doha amongst many other cities in the world have a lot to learn about night clubs; what makes them good and what makes them bad. Predominantly what makes them bad are the clients that frequent them; in the case of Doha they will always be bad. Face facts if you got to a nightclub to pick up women (of any culture) then your not in to clubbing!	0

To the majority of people whom have attended real clubs; go for the music; to get dressed up to impress not only others but themselves. Many clubs are just institutions to carry on drinking after normal club closing time and to pick up members of the opposite sex. Real clubbing....IS.... music; dancing not what has been described on here. This is not just my opinion; there are many clubbing web pages; and you will find it hard pressed to find a description of what is described on this forum. Have you ever been to Ibiza? granted the drug scene is far to prevalent there but it is all about fun music and dancing; not about picking up women!	0

Guys a lebanese club very nearly happened in one of the major hotels; unfortunatly the person in question left Qatar (he was a good friend and I knew his plans and trust me its a complete shame it never went further!!!)

Much more that if we can not find any place for one ; we can go for the other:D For example; there are some nice places making wonderful fruit cocktails; why not play bowling while you drink? A big complex with bowling; billiard; electronic games for adults strongly required... About Alaaddin's Kingdom;it is the only theme park with nothing! It should be more inviting...with some little theatre shows; animal shows; high quality electronic video games; good food; some recreation near sea... In Turkey; they make people to sit on camels for a little tour and take photograph; sorry I couldn't see any camels since I came here(9 months).

Does anyone know of a krav mage; jkd or jujitsu school in doha? please post any details regarding this	I have been doing martial arts for avery long time; and it started with traditional martial arts like Karate/Taekwondo i got black belts in both and was teaching a kids class in texas when i was in university; but then with the new wave of Ultimate fighting and MMA i switched to Muay Thai kickboxing and Brazilian Jui Jitsu; i have trained in them for almost fice years once this year is over. I even went to thailand and trained kickboxing there in the Fiartex camp i stayed there a long time basically life was training all day. I came across Krav Maga when i first started Jui Jitsu; there was a guy teaching it in town and it got alot of hype it was very effectively advertized in the united states and it attracted many people of the age-group 21years+ ; I think the organization made most of its money selling single women a false-sense of security in that if they learnt this they could take on any person in a dark parking lot. Since i only saw one person teaching it i wont judge all Krav M.....	0

Land transportation is a real problem in Qatar.	They don't have to do simple things like tests to get a liscense; they are given the keys to massive SUV's with little or no experience acutally driving a vehicle; they have little or no respect for traffic laws or anyone else on the road; they have speed issues in that anything under 120 kms an hour is two slow.

If you are new and you drive; then wait and see a few Land Cruisers cut you off; make your heart come to your mouth with their speed limit breaking speeds and piss you off by flashing their lights behind you in the fast lane and honking at you at roundabouts like they got shit in their pants. I have been here for 15 years and I have not seen anything change with regards to the way Qatariâ€™s drive. Like MunozC Mentioned itâ€™s a downright attitude problem... They just think; I can drive in my country the way I like and get away with it; you drive and be careful and weep when you try to mess with me. I have friends who have had skirmishes with these guys at times and they have insulted them and even gone to the extent of try to hit them when they have been proved wrong; right in front of the cops.

Yes; and this made it doubly gob-smacking to be hit with a 'you're copped' parking ticket outside Hamad Hospital this week for parking on the kerb (200 yards away from the entrance - I simply needed to catch up with my son who had arrived in an ambulance) - surreal stuff and so unfair!!!!!	0

If someone drives up behind me and they don't flash their lights or get right on the back of my car; I move. I have respect for the patient people here. I'm a fast driver but these people are nuts. I drive fast when I know I have a clearing. I have seen people speed through compounds. I find it nice that when you're on a 2 lane road and there is a bit of a wait at the r/a; people make 4 lanes.

Land transportation is a real problem in Qatar.	It would be good if the Police (or traffic Police)first follow proper driving techniques/rules. ie: 1) hands free phone or preferable park and then speak on the phone. 2) follow speed limit. 3) not drive over footpath in private cruiser with uniform on. 4) immediate fine to anyone driving while holding the phone; or child on drivers lap; or driver with foot on the dashboard; or without seatbelt. 5) point system should be started in Qatar as most of the people breaking the law have the necessary funds. The list can go on. These are the ones I think need immediate attention. the first three points apply to the Police.	1

(maybe a dozen buildings) I think they all have onsite management that can show you what is available. Personally; I think the Pearl and Falcon Towers adjacent to the 4 Seasons Hotel are the best units and best located especially if you are able to join the Four Seasons Spa / Health Club. Al Farden Tower (where the BMW dealer is located) is very nice; but no balconies if that is important to you. 44 Westbay Tower also has very nice units and great views from the upper floors. The residences at the W Hotel are also quite nice; but no balconies.	1

If they don't have the specific for persians; they'll probably order it for you. I think their website is www.dohavets.com or something like that. If I may suggest; if you use an enclosed litter box; bring one with you; as they are very expensive here (QR250 for a really cheap looking one). Also bring toys; they are not easy to find here. And stuff like nail clipper as well. Oh; and frontline is also quite expensive here; and I haven't found the specific one for cats; the vet told me to simply put less of the dog one. Anyway; those are the things you should know if you're bringing kittie with you.	1

So if you want to take on this really big commitment you may want to look for a very healthy bird; not one from a pet shop as tallg and MD recommend. Price should not be the major criteria in a long-term; committed care-taking relationship with a beloved pet. Mandi	0

Q236_R46	Q236_R46_C10	parrot hi all i need to buy a parrot any help for good prices?? thx	herne - obviously it's hard not to feel sorry for the animals in the pet shops; but the worst thing you can do is take pity and buy them because that will only exacerbate the problem; since it gives the shop owners a profit and the incentive to go and get more stock.	0

Not too painful; not too judgmental; not too expensive..	Body sugaring is a method for removing body hair that is a cheap; homemade alternative to waxing (or shaving). The theory behind body sugaring is that the hair is removed by the root; and when it grows back there will be less of it; and it will be softer and not stubbly as it is if a razor had been used. Body sugaring is done by making a paste of sugar; water; and lemon juice that has been heated to the softball candy stage. http://www.care2.com/greenliving/ancient-egyptian-body-sugaring.html# Sounds painful already......	0

Ended up removing more skin than hair (if such thing is possible) and I spent the next couple of days peeling my skin and still had to shave.

Q238_R8	Q238_R8_C2	I'm visiting friends in qatar soon; is it ok to bring packed bacon into qatar? 	You can get in big trouble as pork is banned in Qatar. The same for alcohol!

Q238_R8	Q238_R8_C10	I'm visiting friends in qatar soon; is it ok to bring packed bacon into qatar? 	I came back from Europe last week with 2+ kilos in my checked bag - as did at least a dozen others on the same flight. Alcohol will be confiscated; no doubt about it; but the pork seems to be winked at as it goes through the scanner. I've never heard of anyone being detained or arrested for bringing either into the country - the alcohol was simply confiscated and they were warned not to try and bring it again. Nationality and ethnicity may play a role here. I'm a white Western middleaged female. Asian and other people of colour may have a different experience and perhaps someone can speak to that point. Many Westerners here travel to UAE or Bahrain and bring back pork with no incident (in my 2+ years here).	1

Thanks S	The web site doesn't mention it; but I'm pretty sure you need your RP (Resident's Permit) before you get a liquor licence; and that'll take a few weeks. Most people need much less than their allowance; so if you find a friendly licence holder with spare capacity; you should be OK.	0

"the Al Waha club is a recreation facility within the Al Khor Community gates meaning it serves people working in RasGas and Qatargas. Such clubs inside this kind of facility DO NOT serve alcohol. There is no beer sold in supermarkets or convenience stores. As said above only those with a QDC Liquor permit will be able to get some booze and drink it ""at home"".

Secondly; you would not need an NOC if you're here in Qatar on your husband's sponsorship. You'd need an NOC if your company sponsored your visa even if you're married and you stay with your husband in Qatar. Hope this helps!	1

Q244_R15	Q244_R15_C10	Gluten Free in stock now? Anybody know of a store which has any Gluten Free foods available right now?	You can probably order your GF bread from La Cigale by phone but I think that; the 1st time; it is better to go to the bakery counter or to the casher. Try to get a phone contact or an email for the next orders. Sorry but I may not give you the contacts I got there... The price for a 1/2 kg bread is 50 QAR. It is not cheap but compared to the bread sold in Megamarkt; it is cheap AND better. You can contact me through this email adress : gf.jodemaere@spamgourmet.com !!! this address is a disposable address and will not work anymore after a short while.	1

Q244_R21	Q244_R21_C1	any bakers out there? is there anywhere i can buy shortening to make pie crusts? what about wheat bran etc for muffins? thanks.	shortening is available all over; try the oil aisles; down with the ghee. i think i bought mine in the carrefour in city centre. haven't seen bran; haven't really looked though. not sure its that readily available? try the cold cereal aisle? perhaps that explains the rather white brown bread. the rye bread i bought today must have had only 1 grain of rye as well. was delicious; but not very strong in the rye department. another ingredient that seems to be fairly rare is baking soda. can always find baking powder.	1

Q244_R21	Q244_R21_C3	any bakers out there? is there anywhere i can buy shortening to make pie crusts? what about wheat bran etc for muffins? thanks.	yes; I bake; a LOT!! You can find shortening (Crisco) at Carrefours and/or Megamart; or ShopRite; occasionally. Wheat bran I saw at Megamart just this morning with the other grains....3rd aisle from the left of the store; back section(I believe!) Postmodernman...baking soda is now readily available at Megamart and Shoprite on a regular basis. If you have problems; look for Bicarbonate of Soda..same thing.

Q244_R29	Q244_R29_C4	Food Allergies My children have recently been diagnosed with food allergies. Where can I buy wheat free products; or milk free products; or cheese free products?	I have started cooking from scratch which is probably healthier but its time consuming with three different diets. In the UK you can buy wheat free; milk free and lactose free products. I did find wheat free flour sporadically from Megamart and Soya milk isn't too hard to find but most of it tastes bad.	1
Q244_R29	Q244_R29_C5	Food Allergies My children have recently been diagnosed with food allergies. Where can I buy wheat free products; or milk free products; or cheese free products?	I am suppose to be wheat intolerant but in this country I have given up and am bloated all the time. Mega mart also has wheat free flour to make your own bread; doubles up great for pizza bases; carrefore occasionally stocks wheat free nut bread. Simple treat for you to try is 1 c peanut butter; 1 c sugar; 1 egg. Mix all together; put spoonfuls on a greased tray and bake at 180 for about 20min (golden). They may come out a little soft but will harden. Good luck!   I may be blonde but I am wise smile lots laugh more	0
Q244_R29	Q244_R29_C6	Food Allergies My children have recently been diagnosed with food allergies. Where can I buy wheat free products; or milk free products; or cheese free products?	"Megamart does have the best selection. Edensoy milk is some of the best tasting (especially vanilla). It comes fortified in some varieties. Read labels on everything. If the product is from the US; it will list CONTAINS MILK in bold letters on the bottom of the ingredients. Some poptarts are milk free (cinnamon; strawberry; and apple flavor). Be cautious with chocolate. Milk is in all Cadbury chocolate. Some dark brands are vegan. Megamart also has Soya margarine and ""Smart Balance"" butterflavored spread on occasion. My advice is to stock up when they have it! Also be careful when buying bread; as many have milk as an ingredient. I haven't found any dairy-free cheese in doha. Is the allergy just cow's milk? Can goat or sheep cheese be used? The pharmacy in City Center has chewy bears calcium vitamins if you are looking for supplements. Good luck."	0

Examine the fillets closely; and remove any scales and bones missed by the fishmonger. Fry some finely chopped onion until soft; then add crushed garlic; diced carrot and celery; with a little salt. Cover and sweat for five minutes. Add about 500mL vegetable stock and simmer until the vegetables are cooked. Remove the vegetables with a sieve; then cook the fish fillets in the simmering stock until the flesh has set (no more than 10 minutes). Serve the fish and vegetables with creamy mashed potato.	1

Stuff the cavity with mix peppers; onions and garlic. coat the skin with thinly sliced lemon. Wrap in foil and stick it on the BBQ for 10 minutes. The fish will cook in it's own juices and the lemon stops the flesh from sticking to the foil :o) Did you Google it first?	1

Terramax; People from all countries are residing in Najma area...there are Pionys; Pakistanis; Bangladeshis; Somalians; Egyptians and all others.;;why to blame it on only Indian drivers? The roads are so conjusted with the unique beautiful design of biiiiig roundabouts and smaaaaal circulating roads. Still I am yet to observe any big accident on these roads; believe me as I am a daily commuter on these roads. You have to agree the fact that behind every accident there is a SUV; fortunately not driven by subcontinent drivers.

In that case the sponsor might blacklist you from getting a work visa in Qatar or anywhere else in the GCC. Additionally if there are issues with the bank; they may send a collection agency after you even in your home country to recover any money that you owe. 2 - There could be problems; it depends on point 1. 3 - The bank account will technically remain active. It doesn't close down at the expiration of your RP; otherwise all Qatar residents would need to go to the bank every time they renew their RP. If you have a monthly account fee over time this will bring the account into negative balance; creating a potential problem for you and your sponsor. Leave peacefully and do the right thing by your sponsor. If you leave by going on holiday and not coming back you are only going to make a problem for yourself later.	1

With QNB; you have to have a minimum of Qr 3;000 in your current account always. It’s a compulsory savings scheme. Plus; you get .25% in your savings account and if you take out a mortgage loan you pay 8.5%. Be careful; read the small prints. I don't trust banks here.	0

All grades are full in most schools. Most schools have very long waiting lists - however - come September there will be places because a lot won't come back from Summer holidays and some get 1st/2nd choice - leaving gaps in waiting lists.	1

Q247_R44	Q247_R44_C9	School waiting list I have seen some comments about waiting lists for schools... I would like to know is this for all grade levels?... My son will be going to seventh grade will this be a problem????	Places have been filled by now and waiting lists will have been updated. Schools are not back now until beginning of September (by that I mean school offices) and I am almost sure that whatever school you pick; you will be placed on the waiting list. Have a look at schools suitable to your 'requirements'; but be aware that the more waiting lists you join; the better chance you have to get a place. But first you need to get here as no school will give you a chance to even join the waiting list if you are not physically in Qatar.	1
Q247_R44	Q247_R44_C10	School waiting list I have seen some comments about waiting lists for schools... I would like to know is this for all grade levels?... My son will be going to seventh grade will this be a problem????	This is really late to be trying to find a place for September; try and get his name into as many schools as you're interested in ASAP - There is the ASD; DESS and Doha College which are all probably considered to be the best - but because they are good - their waiting lists can be long. Some have recommended Compass or Sherbourne as well. Do a little googling to see about facilities and contact info - then start communicating with them.	0

As far as I know; HSBC should have recalculated personal loans (back and front calculations) abiding the new QCB regulations.. Any idea on this?	"for banks to reduce their interest rates per QCB's circular. No ifs or buts. The QCB is the governing body of banks. Wikipedia: ""...The primary function of a central bank is to provide the nation's money supply; but more active duties include controlling interest rates (i.e.; price fixing ); and acting as a lender of last resort to the banking sector during times of financial crisis (e.g.; bailouts ). It may also have supervisory powers; intended to prevent banks and other financial institutions from reckless or fraudulent behaviour. Central banks in most developed nations are independent in that they operate under rules designed to render them free from political interference."" If your bank has not reduced its interest rates; then they fall under 'fraudalent behaviour'; which would make them liable."	0

As far as I know; HSBC should have recalculated personal loans (back and front calculations) abiding the new QCB regulations.. Any idea on this?	Yes!!! There was a circular was issued 4-months ago. QCB is allowing banks to charge a maximum interest of 5% per annum and it is a retroactive implementation where the loan shall be re-calculated front and back. Was planning to pay my remaining loan and I learned to know that their computation will be based on the original interest rate when loan was taken. In fact; loan agreement is based on floating rate.

I've managed to find the Commercial bank rate and QNB rate but I cant seem to find HSBC. Does anyone know what it is please? I'm looking at borrowing between 60;000 - 100;000 QR thanks	typically here the interest on Vehicles are almost identical with small differences no more than 1/2 percentile. On personal loans; I am not sure but banks take time before issuing them. Banking here is different from the west. when you arrive to work here your company usually has facilities with certain banks so you can only take facilities from those banks (you can open in any bank a savings account but you will not get any facilities with it). some of the larger companies can send your salary to any bank and then it is up to you to choose. Note that Vehicle loans tend to be straight forward as the bank co-owns your vehicle until you pay your loan back however; personal loans take more time (at least a couple of month where your salary is transferred regularly) before it is approved. Here; there is no credit history that you can transfer with you. it is all about where your salary gets transferred and which company is sponsoring you. Bottom line; don't bother with researching any oth.....	0

Just you need to sign the papers. But for used cars interest rate will be little more; around 7%.	0

F'co a little progress everyday adds up to big results	e643 is right and they have narrow opening hours so i can only go on saturday mornings and sit and wait and wait. i have been a customer for almost 4 yrs and i dont like them. i have removed most of my money and go in to remove my salary every two months. cancelled all my cards with them. QNB is good because their opening hours are much more convenient. also they have branches in shopping malls so parking isn't the big issues like hsbc. check out their website. they still have big queues in some branches......my friend went in took a ticket; went home; made her breakfast; ate; tidied up; drove back to QNB and still was in a queue - ha ha but that is most banks here! banks do islamic and non-islamic banking so u can do either. i have a financial consultant who does my savings for me independent of any bank in qatar.	0

Q250_R23	Q250_R23_C4	What is the best bank in Qatar; the best service; your experience; all aspects of manage? Your experience with banks in Qatar; some recommend; there is lot of banks but the best is...	CBQ with no doubt. Their range of services and their network are really convenient for customers add to this their accurate customer service. CBQ is the best bank in Qatar when it comes to a number of services like Online; call center. (I also have account in QNB and I know quite well about Doha Bank) IBQ doesn't have online service at all. Network; CBQ is the bank that has the widest presence in malls (Hyatt; Villagio; city center; lulu HM; Landmark) with all convenience this brings to customers in terms of proximity and working hours. Customer service in CBQ is better than that of QNB and Doha bank. I'm not talking about people who smile only but about their accuracy and professionalism as well. They may be less flexible than other banks but for me personally I preferred their services over all other banks (and I have dealt with many of them)	1

Q250_R23	Q250_R23_C9	What is the best bank in Qatar; the best service; your experience; all aspects of manage? Your experience with banks in Qatar; some recommend; there is lot of banks but the best is...	CBQ is the best; I have accounts in QNB; Standard Chartered & Doha Bank. Call center agents of CBQ are really professionals and very well trained staff. They have a excellent telephone manners. Doha bank call center very poor; I always feel like I'm not welcome to ask any questions for what else I want to know. Sometimes they need to transfer to another agent but I'm not satisfied of their answers regarding my problem. Standard Chartered bank is trying too much to be the best but I'm sorry to them they are very far from CBQ call center. They register me to receive sms if ever any transactions made from my account. Only one time I receive sms from them. QNB is one of the worst; I've issued cheques for my car loan and I have agreement with the person responsible for my cheques but still it's nothing. What's funny with this guy; he act that he type something in the computer and promise it will not happened anymore. How disgusting!. http://www.lizaqat.blogspot.com	1

I'm off to the bank now in person; lets see what happens. I'd be on the lookout if you do bank with them.	Just an update.... I do have a fixed rate loan apparently it means nothing to them. I should feel better that this change is across the board; 'for everybody; new and exsisting loans'(in case I felt left out; I suppose). What was really amusing was how I was told this is an International Bank (???) and keeps up with the markets hence interest rates can go up and down. I don't seem to recall them going down when the US Dollar hit rock bottom!!! Also regarding not informing me about the increase....'we have 1000's of customers we can't tell everybody!' I wish I could say they were saving the environment by not sending out letters but what's the excuse for not sending an email or text? Anyway long story short; I'm moving banks and am very glad to; good riddance to old rubbish. I do wish I could meet the people who gave them all those awards for 'Excellence in banking' etc we must not be talking about the same Doha Bank. Goodluck to all those who continue to bank with them.	0

Vegas... re-read the post; nothing to do with late payment; just a general across-the-board increase in interest rates. Basically the bank trying to squeeze every penny out of people (especially those who have being paying on time; because this would mean they have the money; no use trying to get money out of someone who doesn't have it)to cover any losses they may have sustained while 'playing' the markets.	1

Hi Lamea! im kinda new in here but what I know about islamic banking is that they got much lower rates and a certain portion is donated to their Muslim Communities who need help - gotta think from the more positive angle since we are living in their world we gotta live by it. Otherwise go to America or Europe instead but for me Islam and Islamic banking is good. Just a thought. No offense meant ok? Cheers!

Best regards. Have a nice weekend everyone.	Hi Casanova; I'm sorry to disappoint you with this; HSBC is just like any other bank in Doha; and it's even worse because they charge for every thing. Don't be amused by this word (The World's Local Bank); they are right in it's local; but it's not universal. you can ask them about something to do with another HSBC world wide; they will tell you: sorry; there is no networks between our banks in the world; so it's just local bank. I'm telling you this; since I'm dealing with five different bank in Qatar; and HSBC was even lower level than others; it's just a big name; the only good thing about them; that they provide you parking in the main branch in Banks street. I think Doha; Almashreq; and the commercial banks are better options. Best regards	1

Thanks.	just my 5 cent worth of opinion: not all the things you need; you should buy abroad just because they are more expensive in doha. i wouldnt buy a baby cot and brought it over to doha. likewise for diapers (pampers). how many packs of pampers can you buy from abroad for a good one year supply; just because they might be cheaper abroad. my opinion is you should consider buying things; which are not in Qatar; from your home country. even if you try to avoid paying more on baby stuff; you will eventually spend more on something else out here and at the same time paying less for other things too; like car and petrol.	0

If you're shipping a container over from the uk then my advise would be to bring E V E R Y T H I N G and more :) It's painful to pay 3 if not 4 times as you would back home. Wipes are ripoff.

Q252_R3	Q252_R3_C10	cheapest fare flight service to dubai? which is the cheapest fare flight service from doha to dubai ? pls tell me the round trip price also....i am planning to visit there with my family. thanks friends	Amadeo; Sharjah to Dubai is really just 25 minutes travel by car if there is no traffic at the National Paint area. Traffic starts from 7 to 9am and from 5 to 8pm during week days. There is a short cut to avoid traffic if the driver knows it. But I don't suggest the OP to go for Air Arabia as it has only slight difference with the air ticket rates compared with the Fly Dubai. Sometimes; FlyDubai is even cheaper (if you dont have baggage to check-in) and it is convenience to any means of transportation...you can take bus; taxi or metro.	0

They probably won't be happy about it; but at that time you would have another job so it won't be like they can keep you from finding something. ****************************************** What difference does it make to the dead whether the mad destruction is wrought under the name of totalitarianism or democracy? -Gandhi ******************************************	1

I don’t think you will immediately adjust to the country. It takes years when things go right; but at the moment life isn't easy there (high unemployment and huge tax loads). If you have a family to take care of; perhaps it would be wiser not to take risks when you have little chances to succeed. Take leave (don't disclose the reason to your employer) and go there to assess personally the situation. Good luck!	1

They base their families there and continue working in the Gulf with higher packages (because of the new passport). So; it all comes down to what your REAL intentions are. I would go with Baldricl's suggestion that you do the honourable thing and resign. perhaps you could get a commitment from your employer that he would consider taking you back in six months time if needed. Good luck anyway :)	1

So they might give you the offer; but they cannot provide you the visa to come here. So just wait for their go-ahead before you resign from your current job.	1

I went to Thailand for 3 weeks at Christmas/New Year and visited a few different places; but if you only have 5 days then you'll probably only be able to do one place. Bangkok is probably your best bet as I expect that's where you're flying to/from; and it has plenty to do for 5 days. The Lonely Planet has plenty of good suggestions of what to do; but I can give you more specific ideas if you want. We also went to Chiang Mai in the north which is lovely. Still a city with lots to see in and around it; but it seems to have a far more chilled vibe than Bangkok. If you fancy proper chilling then I'd recommend down south. We stayed on the Andaman coast at Khao Lak and Ko Lanta (north and south of Phuket respectively). Both had a nice relaxed atmosphere - not as manic as I'm led to believe Phuket is. 	1

These sites usually have a great line up of hotels and their basic rates with facilities available including their pictures. Once you have identified the hotel you would like to stay in; search for the hotel name on google and book the rooms from the hotel website. Majority of hotels offer best rates available in the market thru their own website. Makes sense as they save on commission or brokerage charges from third party websites. ---------------------- 3000 QL Points Way to go Ray! ----------------------	1

Thailand; Vietnam; or Malaysia caters from the 5 star to budget travellers. Air fares with Qatar Airways is approx QR3;000 to Thailand; you may find cheaper fares with Gulf Air; leaving you QR 2;000 for hotels etc. Take a look at Air Asia's web site. It is SE Asia's budget airline and can fly you cheaply and connecting you to nearby neighbouring countries and has many hotel prices listed too. If time is not an issue you can also take the bus from say Malaysia to Thailand; or Thailand to Vietnam or Cambodia. Best of luck	1

Q256_R13	Q256_R13_C3	where QL members meet ; enjoy & make fun. can any body tell me where all the qatar living members meet on holidays . how to find them ?	Ql members are easily identifiable in a crowd. Just watch out for the following characteristics. a) The males will have long flowing beard (Look at my avatar for an idea about how it would look); which will be always unkempt and unruly. If there is a bird which has nested in his beard; that means he is the most senior among them and also the wisest. I tried to make a nest in my beard and invite a bird in; but none would touch it. I wonder why? b) b) The females will almost always have flowing; shiny; silver hair and they will have eyes lined in VIBGYOR – all colours of the rainbow. The more colours they have around their eyes; the more senior in QL they are. Age does not come in here. All of them are very young and nubile. Its very easy to find them in a crowded place because if two QL ladies get together; they will start singing “my heart will go on” at the top of their voices. c) HABITAT They are usually found near beaches and shopping malls where they go away for their hunting.....	1

"The other day; i met one of the most senior members of QL - Darude. Each time he shook hands with a person; two birds came out through the two sides of his beard singing ""cuckoo; cuckoo"". I envied him. I didnt have even ONE bird in my beard while he had two. I also saw a few bisuit crumbs on his beard. I have a strong suspicion that he is using Britania bisuits to lure the birds into his beard. I have made a proposal to the birds saying that i would give them swiss chocolate biscuits if they relocated. Lets see how the negotiations go. Will have to stamp their RP's very soon so that they dont leave me anytime soon. Note to self: Give birds Residence permit; land cruiser allowance; two way tickets (even if they can fly on their own) and a free hand in doing what they will with their nest s; provided it will ALWAYS remain within MY beard!"	0

Q257_R22	Q257_R22_C1	Is it just me...Or does anyone else find working on a Saturday a waste of time ?

What's that all about! Really cuts into the 'break' and means Friday evening out is a 'no no'. I think they use Saturday morning to hold meetings to catch up on events; but I often forget it's a half day and get a surprise (pleasant) when hub suddenly appears home around 1.00 p.m. or earlier. Anywhere else I've lived in the Middle East the week end has been Thursday and Friday with; maybe; Thursday afternoon as well as Friday being the time off.	1

Hi;Canadian Luda Moving to Qatar in mid-August is a no no.But if you have no choice...Why do I say that??Because the weather is awful.But once you get to Oct-Nov. you will enjoy it. Regarding the shipment;there is no point in doing that since the company will provide you with a fully furnished appartment/villa.You will find everything here(house-holds;china;etc)at a reasonable price. Visa-it depends on how fast the company you will be working for is. What to expect when you arrive??hhhmm...difficult question.A lot of dust;heat and a lot of humidity :) I don't know how much you know about Qatar.But if you have any questions just let me know.

I moved in August as well. but atleast you can comfort yourself in knowing you're hitting the worst weather by that time and its only positive from then on. Quick addition: I do suggest you actually move with stuff... especially if you and your partner are doing this together. clothing is expensive here and if it's just 'your own stuff' that you want around the house; pack a few boxes of clothes you want; pics; music or books or whatever. everything retail and consumable is expensive. As for a moving company.... I've used Crown Relocations on all of my last 3 moves between countries and they are top notch in every place. Visa stuff... let the employer take are of that. I can recommend that you have at minimum 2 certified and originals of all legal documents (birth certs; marriage certs; etc.)... it is easier if you need them later on than having to wait to obtain them.

It would be awesome if we had our own Hindi channel. I am a Pakistani but I love hindi movies and music. I do listen to radio 4 FM 89.1 and city FM 101.6 but we do not get them all year round.

Most countries require you to have at least 6 months remaining on your passport before they will allow you to enter. I had the same problem as you whilst living in Panama. I am a resident there but with a UK passport. I was going on a 2 day business trip to Mexico and had to renew my passport before I left Panama. Therefore; if you live here but do not have a Qatari passport; you will require to renew your passport before you leave for your trip.	1

My PP expires on 25th May (Final) and I wish to go for a short vacation in 9th April and return on 25th April; do I need to get my pass renewed before I travel?	I dont think it is necessary to have 6 months validity while you hold a valid Residence Permit. 6 months validity of a PP is required if you are travelling to a country without having a valid visa for that country and you will not get a visa if you does not have 6 months valid Passport as well. In this case I would suggest you to renew your Passport before you go on leave as you do not have too many days left. You are planning to come back at the end of April and in case if you are not able to travel your Passport will get expired and you will be in trouble. So play safe.	0

Brit; I might have to disagree with you on this one. Cost of living in home countries? I can assure you that in India; some people have a REALLY high cost of living. Like anywhere else; you can get very similar foods/item for very cheap or very expensive. Depends on how rich you are and on your lifestyle. Average living standards and governmental services vary between a 3rd world country and Europe but that is it. Plus; if someone is living here; who cares how much a soda can costs back home? Why can't that person Mr (kumar) enjoys his weekend in Qatar like Mr (John) does with his family? I bet you Mr kumar's kids and wife would like to have gourmet food every once in a while. I am glad I am white. But nothing pisses me off more than Racism and especially when it gets acknowledged by those who benefit from it! :) you know better brit.	0

Also BE; having worked in HR here for a while; it is common practise for companies to ask what your current salary is and they will base their offers on that. For instance; 2 Civil Engineers; one from the US and one from Philippines you will find that the one from the philppines will be on say 8000QAR and maybe the one from the states will be on 21QAR (in their home country). HR will base their offer on how much extra (or not) they can get away with offering above what they currently earn. So you can't give someone who is on 8kqar currently over 20k and similarly you cannot offer someone who is on 21k less than that because he thinks; why would I want to come here for less than I am currently earning at home. Also back to BE's point; rents; mortgages general cost of living in India and Philippines is much less than it is in most of Europe and North america. And lastly for those that say why not hire all from India etc because there is nothing more detrimental to a good company than hir.....	1

If someone cannot save for a better life when they go home; will simply not come in the first place and companies have slowly realised that hiring all from one nation does not work; so they have to pay more for a mix of people. However; what I have noticed is that people from say india who have lived in the ME a while; their salaries do start to become more equitable as they change jobs - based on their current salary and each time they change; voila; their salaries go up. What I also notice is that alot of westerners; their salaries do not change much; they were already being paid the top for what they are doing and cannot get much higher by changing jobs.	1

Known somebody whose asking this kind a question;;; hope somebody can give us an answer. thanks	Yes friend you can; somebody think that she have to change her religion to muslim; that is not true ; as she is a Christian lady; she can worship the God as per Christian instructions; and Islam religion respect other religion specially christian ; so no problem at all.the verse versa is prohibited ; but if a muslim lady wants to married a christian man ; not allowed and everybody know the reason. Go ahead ; enjoy life ; and count from 1 to 10 while you ask this question: can I control my kids believing in future? what is her attitude when you get up early to prey alfajr; what type of food you will share together ; what about Ramadan fasting ....so many questions. and the most importent question : why you fail to find an Egyption lady ?

People wants to quit smoking not because they wish; but because it is injures to health. If you really wish from your bottom of heart; then chances to quit smoking is more. But if is because someone is insisting or due to health reason; then you may really need more efforts. I wish you success. Does the QL members agree on the aove point.	0

"Hello; Quitting is easier said than done for most smokers. I am like you until last year. Used to finish 20 sticks a day.Started this habit since 1987 until 2010. I tried sometimes to quit but usually they are either due to my girlfriend nagging or jus trying. Usually even with success on stopping for a week; I resume again; sometimes 3 months and picked up the habit. You will have to decide and discipline yourself. Even a puff.... From what I can remember; I used a combination of sub-concious method:- 1) I do not stick with one brand of cigarette switch around also between heavy and light ones but toward light ones more. And I by when I finish...never maintain a backup pack or reach from friends. (this has impact; I noticed almost immediately I hate the different brands and sometime even dislike the brand this is good cos you are still holding the cigarette but smoke less as you ""hate""d the taste) 2) Started some simple exercise like jogging or any sports (good preparation to clear yo....."	1

"Dear Friend; First of all let me tell you that there is nothing wihich can stop you from smoking other than your WILL TO GIVE UP SMOKING. You need to first understand what is the thing which make you smoke. 1. your mindset : It wants support! support of some kind which will give peace to your mind during tension / stress / anger etc. In case of smokers its ""smoking"" So you have to build your own support mechnism : like Music (which ever you like) any physical activiy like cycling; exercise; playing tennis ; football; swimming anything...and that u only can identify. 2. Nicotine Cycle / Levels of Nicotine in blood: This is the nicotine content in the blood which gets lowered and bue to which the necotine which is absorbed by your lungs enters into your blood through your lungs (alveolies) and carried into the blood stream through arteries to Heart and pumped to Brain through arteries. this whole process is called as Nicotine cycle.

I was honestly pissed off with myself when I did stop and the truth hit home how much damage I had done to myself and to my relationships for so long and all FOR NOTHING!! There was no cold turkey; no shakes; no cough; no sudden uncontrollable energy; no sudden weight gain; etc. etc. What did happen? Anxiety and stress LEFT!! And the smell of stale smoke and the taste of it became more repulsive than ever. And I suddenly was open to socialising with people that didn't smoke! It was actually annoyingly easy to stay quit!

So i am attempting to quit smoking cold turkey ; has anyone ever quit smoking ; discuss ; and what negative side effects have you experienced from quitting initially ? What are the positives after quitting as well?	I quit two years ago. Was quite tough. I used nicotine chewing gums for first few days. I still dream of smoking and feel I am just a millimeter (or a puff)away from being an addict again. Don't allow yourself even a single puff for me. Stay away from ambience which makes you feel like smoking. Quit one hundred percent. Don't give any concessions to yourself; be ruthless. Positives of quitting far outweigh the negatives. I did gain weight but reduced it as I could execise better now. Smoking anyway is outlawed almost everywhere. It's out of fashion too. I don't blame my previous generation for glorifying it as they did know less about the harms. If someone picks up the habit now or still continues with it then he or she definitely is an ignorant person. It makes you sick and smelly.	1

Also WHY! why put your body through such mental and physical stress to resist the urge to have that beautiful puff! let me list out a few advantages of smoking 1. Taking a crap in the morning is so much more relaxed and mentally soothing when your on the throne with a ciggie. Its just comes out better. 2. Say your the only guy who doesnt smoke and all your other friends smoke; you'll be looked as that ""loser"" guy. Your not a loser when you smoke; you make MORE friends when you smoke.

Nothing will help you quit smoking but yourself. I was a smoker 5+ years ago..

It ran my throat dry and I felt like hypnotised. Bad remedy really. THIS APPROACH FAILED. 3- Determination. When I use to smoke; i leave the office to smoke and interrupt work; i make my car smelling cigarrets; it destroyed my health and i become like a dog after running for a minute or so. So I decided to stop smoking no matter what because I said to myself that all consequences and health issues that affect me from smoking have to stop. This solution WORKED!!! You have to convince yourself that you must stop. Don't fool urself thinking u r addicted and cannot stop. It is an addiction but you can live normally without it.

Does anyone know what charges are involved and is there any info online? Regards PS- what's the weather like there in April?	We didn't get charged anything extra at this end. Give a note to the courier company stating it's personal belongings and you will be taking them back when you leave Qatar; then they will give it to customs.

Find a good forwarder in the UK who could deliver your stuff door-to-door (that's DDP; Delivered Duty Paid for Incoterms 2000); so receiver should not worry about anything to pay as shipper will pay all the charges before it can be shipped out from the UK to Qatar. DHL; UPS and Fedex can handle this kind of shipment; just dont forget; Shipping Terms should be DDP in the Airway Bill. btw; April weather starts to warm; hot season's peak July and August Cheers!	1

I would say good gas grills are expensive compared to Canada; the US and Australia but are becoming more available. As for compatibility; I have the charcoal grill (all I need is lighter fluid) but I understand there are serious issues with North American gas grill compatibility but someone else would have to speak to the specifics.	1

We purchased one from Lowes and had it shipped unassembled (still in the box) and don't regret it one bit. I do recommend having a cover for it else the dust and grit will quickly work its charm. You can change the hoses and connections fairly easily once you arrive. The canisters are larger in Doha than they are in the U.S.; so don't count on the tank fitting under your grill.	1

I've sent n received too many times with all of them.Each time i experienced to send sensetive papers as you meantioned.But what I noticed that DHL is the fastest one incase you have limited time n hurry for something.

Some sellers on eBay will ship direct to Qatar as well. You will need to decide if it's wiser to spend the extra on shipping or perhaps buy locally. Aramex are a cost effective shipper from the states and the UK. When you join their Shop & Ship service they give you a postal address in the USA and UK. You have you items delivered to that address; and then they forward your goods to a depot here at reasonable rates. I don't think selling items on eBay is a viable option from Qatar. But somebody else may think otherwise.	1

I might try to list some of my things to sell as well. I am wondering about shipping and fees and so on. Does anyone have experience with this?	Ebay is good.. two things. mind where you are buying the stuff from. if you are buying from china or Hongkong; then the seller would ship the item to Qatar with HK post which is cheap and most of the times he offers it free; but the wait time is minimum one month and 45 days is normal. you can opt to get it by HK registered post too with additional shipping cost ranging from $4 to $20; which is much faster and secure. if you are buying from other countries like US; the standard shipping is done with USPS which is no better than HK post; its take a month too; alternatively if you opt to get it shipped with UPS/DHL/FedEx from the buyer; then price for shipping ranges anywhere from $140. alternatively to buy from the US seller is Easyshop by DHL; or shop n ship by Aramex. check their website to know how they work.	1

I am thinking of trying the one I listed above just to see how it works. I think it is in Qatar; so the shipping may be better.

Personally i recommend Dell; Lenovo; Acer and Asus. 4. Depending on your budget you should look for the best options. At the moment the best configurations that don't cost that much are core i5 Second Generation; 4 GB ram; 500+ GB Hard-Drive; 15.6 inch screen. The graphic card is a plus but not mandatory since i5 second generation has a pretty good integrated graphics (basically the better the CPU the better the graphics performance). So at this time i would recommend: Dell inspiron 15r: i5 SG; 500GB; 4 GB RAM; GT525M - 1GB graphic memory - this was bought by a friend of mine from sofitel with 2300QR. Something cheaper than that: Acer has some laptops that are very cheap but give very good performance. They are using some old CPU's brought back to life by the Second Generation from Intel (like Celeron). This i have right now: Acer Aspire 5349: Celeron b800 (.....	1

Sony VAIO is the best as it is built around a Blue Ray Disk drive; one that can write 25Gb of data on a DVD. BD Drives have better visual & audio capability than HD Drives. followed by Toshiba's Qosimos series. 3rd is Apple. Strangly apple does not talk about HD-drives or BD-drives!
