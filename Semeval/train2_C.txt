Like Dracula said; buy; dont rent...but for that price; you can go to Obeidly (in Sofitel)...but i think they have older cars. Some running alright but i would avoid them. They do have some good prices on the newer cars though. Just dont rent from Petra. They have lousy cars and they rip their clients off. The charge their credit cards without consent and then refuse to help settle the issue.	0

For family with 2 child; you ll probably need 2BR flat which will cost about 7000-8000 and for schooling you ll probably need 4000-5000. so it means these two will take major chunk of your salary.

Q201	Q201_R26_C2	which mobile is best under 2000QR i want to buy new mobile.... and i want to know which mobile is best is under 2000QR....	Aamirjaved's calculation is somewhat on the high side. I believe you should be able to get a 2BR within QR 5000 and also you can easily manage your monthly expenses within QR 2000. For the schooling; if you are an Asian; it is not that costly to my understanding. As such; my view is that if you are an Asian; grab the offer; but if you are a westerner; kick it.	0

We can't say if it's a good deal - you don't include details of the role. Try to get schooling included in the package. Agree with aamirjaved. Depends on what standard of living you want.

Q201	Q201_R27_C6	which mobile is best under 2000QR i want to buy new mobile.... and i want to know which mobile is best is under 2000QR....	I think it will depend on what kind of lifestyle you want here; what nationality are you? If you are western I would say you wont save much out of 20k; you would want a decent apartment / villa; good social life; weekends away. If you are the sort of person who is just coming here to work work work; then you will be able to save more. It will be trial and error until you find the balance that suits you and the lifestyle you want to have.	0

Q201	Q201_R27_C10	which mobile is best under 2000QR i want to buy new mobile.... and i want to know which mobile is best is under 2000QR....	I see a lot of people have already written a reasonable answer; but keep in mind following: - about flat or car rental - depends who negotiates. If a European person or a westerner in general - forget it to find those rates. For them everything is double. - as many have mentioned - depends on lifestyle. For example one of the most difficult issues for women here - to find a normal hairdresser; beautician; etc. usually too expensive and very low quality / level of hygiene. If you go to a normal place - prices are ridiculous for what you get.	0

Because there are not too much specialty stores that caters only professional cameras (DSLRs). Mostly camera stores can be found only in malls but they are not specialty stores. You know how mall owners jack-up prices of goods; especially if it comes or imported outside Doha. If you have friends in UAE; you can ask them to buy you one and just shipped it you. Or; there are some people selling DLSRs here in QL. You can search the classified ad here.	0

Nervous Mom	I have been flashed twice at the Toyota Tower Signals for jumping the red light but luckily the cameras are still in the testing phase. Not all those ugly speed cameras are fully operational. They havent all yet been connected to the ministry of interior's sever. Once I was behind a truck at a signal and I couldnt see whether it was green or red when I was crossing. These huge trucks block the sight of the signals. They have to do something about it. Anyways I would definitely advise people not to jump redlights and slow down at the singals.	0

What is the procedure for this? kindly reply thanks	correct... just follow what darude's suggest... 1> get married. 2> once handed the marriage documents; let your wife to ask from his current Sponsor to change sponsorship to HUSBAND SPONSORSHIP; u may do that instantly or upon expiry of you wife's visa. your wife can still continue with her current job without leaving the country. 3>ask for Mandoub services to do the job; it is only a simple paperwork to change sponsorship. 4>if your wife wishes to quit the job; she may do so... so many reasons to tell the previous sponsor for quiting the job like she is pregnant... after giving birth reasons like she needs to care for you infant. ~~~ There is no substitute for victory yet there is risks of too much oversight... ~~~	1

Because if she gets caught without the legal authorisation you could be facing a fine upto 25000 riyals. Having said that; don't be daunted the paperwork just takes a day or two and is well worth your protection and that of her prospective employers.	0

Insurer of your money / bank would pay that amount to bank; may be insurer and bank are having offices in the same building / or managers are cousins / they are after your money / so escape clear from both parties / Pray hard / Good luck in finding another job soon somewhere / Regards.	0

What is the procedure for this? kindly reply thanks	without government approval of your marriage; you won't get a family visa back into Qatar; unfortunately. Marrying you out of the country can cause major problems for your fiance; so I would suggest you wait until your marriage is approved. The only other option is that you relocate somewhere else; marry there; but your marriage will not be valid in Qatar; and you will have no claim to any inheritences if god forbid; something should happen to him. Does your fiance not have some Wasta; that can obtain your release from your company? I am not saying that will make things any easier; since you still need to have the govt approval for marriage; but at least you can be in Qatar; near him.	1

What is the procedure for this? kindly reply thanks	its quiet; but you can find things to do if you really want to. Now..being happy will depend on a lot of things; to be honest. Are you single..do you have a very active night life...etc... I don't have a curfew..I think that might depend upon what job you have and the requirements. Active night life..there is one but its limited. I see you are from the UK..will be honest with you and say its nothing like the pub scene back there. Clubs and pubs are located ONLY in hotels. Easy to get around if you drive..but you have to be aggressive in your driving manner and defensive...;) I just like it here; for many many reasons...but you DO need to look at all the perspectives before coming here. ONE main one is that the riyal is pegged to the dollar..NOT the English Pound...	0

Q204	Q204_R17_C3	OBGYN in Doha Does anyone know of a good OBGYN in Doha	First; you have to be 100 % sure if you are preggy or not. Go to the hospital a.s.a.p so you can have a pregnancy blood test. Better go early so you can wait for the result within 1-2 hours. They will ask you prior to that if you are married the say YES; since you are really married right? 2nd - Does your employer knows that your husband is in town or not? If they know that he is here; then leave it as it is. Have you mention to your employer or interviewers before that you are married? Or have submitted a marriage contract as part of the HR formalities?.. Then leave it again. Then just go on with your pregnancy and do your best to invite your husband to come back in DOHA. Further; Make sure that you are living with your trusted friends or relatives to avoid rumors; etc.	0

Q204	Q204_R17_C9	OBGYN in Doha Does anyone know of a good OBGYN in Doha	"'kaliwali""... don't be scared; We are only allowed to be scared to GOD and no one else. You go to Phil. Embassy and apply for the authentication of ur Marriage Contract. Then go to Qatar Ministry (somewhere in Corniche) sorry can't figure out the exact name of this gov't agency. Show them the authenticated marriage contract and they will stamp that contract (arabic text). So at least you are protected with that paper. Anytime somebody ask you then just show the paper;to keep their mouth shut. Keep on praying don't stress yourself too much as you are entering the most memorable and exciting stage of womanhood.

If so I think is best if you leave it untreated; I used to have a lot of pain in my back too and it dissapeared after giving birth. It is normal; it doesn't mean that there is something ""wrong"" with your back. Anyways; there are lots of doctors here. The Hammad women hospital is very good and have modern equipment; I was treated there.. I also heard very good things about Al Emadi and the Doha Clinic. I did try the American Hospital and didn't like it at all. Women Hospital: 439 6666 Al Emadi: 466 6009 Doha Clinic: 432 7300 Doha Chripractic Centre: 4650012 HOpe that helps."	1

Q204	Q204_R32_C10	OBGYN in Doha Does anyone know of a good OBGYN in Doha	hello ditto; i do think you need to see a chiropractor; and if you do have back pain of course it means there is something wrong with your back. SInce you are pregnant your pelvis is expanding which causes pain in your lumbar and pelvic also due to the extra weight. Therefore the best treatment for you is chiropractic; its not only for your back pain but also for optimum health of the baby and you.The chiropractic approach to better health is to detect;reduce;and help pervent nervous system dysfunction.	0

I personally know of 1 baby who is still in the NCU of Hamad Hospital now; that had to be transferred from Al-Ahli. Stay far away from al-Ahli hospital and consider Hamad Hospital.

Q204	Q204_R40_C8	OBGYN in Doha Does anyone know of a good OBGYN in Doha	Thanks you all for the responses; althought i must say that i've been quite worry about some comments. Are you people sure about those things (that a ahli don't have NICU)?? Did you actually gave birth on hamad or other hospital to say that or this is like that kind of stuff that you hear somebody saying and reapeat as if was realy truth?? I'm asking because chosing a hospital/doctor far away from your home country is a very dificult decision; and al ahli hospital doesn't look like the kind of place you described. I like to hear from someone who actually delivered there. Is there anyone?? Thanks	0
Q204	Q204_R40_C9	OBGYN in Doha Does anyone know of a good OBGYN in Doha	Her first three were at Hamad Medical and her last child was born in Al Ahli ONLY because she wanted her husband to attend the delivery. she compared all four deliveries and decided never to go back to Al Ahli. They are rude and broke her water - without her approval. She was emotionally and phsycologically abused by the nurses there. They wouldn't call her doctor when she was asked them to. We had to call her from our personal mobiles. Not a very pleasant experience. I'm having all my children at Hamad Medical.	1

Q204	Q204_R46_C8	OBGYN in Doha Does anyone know of a good OBGYN in Doha	"Dr S; I have checked with a friend doctor at Hamad Hospital; and these are some feedbacks that I gather : 1. HMC plans to become a full fledged Specialist Hospital soon; therefore they don't take in Residents anymore. Anyway; there is an exception to this...if you're enrolling the ""Arab Board"" Program; you'll be appointed as Resident. ""Arab Board"" is a 4-year program to become Specialists. 2. To enroll the Arab Board; HMC together with Weill Cornell Medical College conducts a yearly entrance exam (normally in Sept). In the recent exam; the passing mark was 55. 3. Salary for Resident is about QR 8;200/month (excluding Housing). 4. If you have relevant experience and qualifications; you will either be appointed Clinical Associate/ Specialist/ Consultant."	0

So actually you have to star from searching job. As has been mentioned; try to browse Internet for the advertismenets. Then you can get phone/fax numbers and e-mails of particular hotels; and send your CVs directly to these hotels. When you find the job; the Comapany will issue visa for you; and only after that you can come to Qatar.

There seems to be little support for those who lag behind in a particular subject. Also the number of UK qualified teachers with QTS (Qualified Teacher Status) is limited. You may wish to ask how many of the teachers actually have QTS compared to those that don't. Many of the teachers are not from the UK and do so not have a background of teaching a British Curriculum. Finally; Parkhouse only follows part of the National Curriculum of England and Wales. The rest of the curriculum is based around what is referred to as the International Curriculum; which is created by a private company in the UK and is not endorsed by the government. This topic has been discussed a number of times previously so you may wish to do a search to get a better idea of the school. You may also wish to try other UK curriculum schools such as Doha College; DESS; Sherborne and the International School of London. Good luck.	1

ALL their teacher comply with SEC conditions on qualifications of their teachers; otherwise they would not be able to operate! I can confirm the vast majority of teachers at the school are British; 2nd is South African (excellent standard of educated teachers) and other nationalities. The school is as british as it gets in a non-british country. The standards are extremely high. There is very positive school/parent contact and all pupils are expected to work hard; are well disciplined; and result focused. I am british and my children attend Park House. I would have no problem with them returning to the UK (not likely with the current working conditions in the UK!) and slipping into very good schools and coping with the change. If you are typical middle class parents who discipline your children and make sure they stay on top of their studies you will reap the benefit of this school which.....	1

Not only is that wrong; but on top of it they miss what is happening in their class. And don't try and tell me it's not true - I was a volunteer parent last schoolyear for Year 1. Is this the way to save on spending more time with the children who need more reading practice? Why not do like the French School - extra hours of tuition after school? Last swimming competition the kids were so excited to show what they could do - instead the swimming teacher used her own son to get a better place for Park House. The amount of dissapointed faces of children was heartbreaking! Waiting hours for nothing? Things are far less positive then what you make them seem!	0

Maybe you should change schools for your kids and give those parents who would remove their right arm to put their kids into Park House their place. In the UK all primary schools ask parents to come into the lower primary classes to hear the children read. I can't understand what could be better than one-to-one reading. If you want to suggest a reading group after school which parents fund I am sure the school would be interested in your suggestion. In the Uk books were changed once a week - here in Park House its three times a week; their books are set based on their individual ability into small groups if possible. The teacher hears the pupil read at least once a week. Parents are asked to participate in their child's learning by listening to their child read at home. Schooling is not a vacuum - a child can learn at anytime anywhere. As for fairness - the World is not fair and.....	0

For example; are we comparing Parkhouse (or any other school in Doha) with fee-paying; independent schools in the UK or are we trying to compare them with state schools in Britain? As Parkhouse is a fee-paying school; I would have thought that the former would be a fairer point of comparison. One person has written that the standards at Parkhouse are ""extremely high"". Well; if there is an acute shortage of school places; then it stands to reason that some of the more popular schools can be very selective about who they allow in through the gates. I have not heard much about Parkhouse's Special Educational Needs policies and I suspect that they would not want to admit SEN children because that might affect their ""extremely high standards"". That also might explain Parkhouse's preference for nice; white English children. Craftyqueen has mentioned the SEC; the Supreme Council of Education. This is a ....."	0

Even people who are not local and come from the subcontinent and claim to speak english do not understand you or prove able to articulate their thoughts in english. I'm not trying to upset anyone; but i'm calling it like I see it. This is a true story: I called the information number provided on the Qatar Foundation website to get some information on the American universities you hear so much hype about; and was shunted through 4 different people who could not speak english! This isn't an obscure gvt office in the ministry of islamic studies or whatever....this was QATAR Foundation!! SO: No! English is not a main language in Qatar...and is mostly spoken by the European and North American Expat communities only. Stay safe all. Perfection does not exist. The question therefore; is: what level of imperfection are we willing to settle for?	0

Im a trained english language teacher and would like to find out where I could find some employment in the city ..... any advice will greatly be appreciated	Good Morning; Unfortunately; this is a melting pot for different languages Tagalog; Hindi; Urdu; Arabic and English please forgive any languages I forgot. Now not wishing to offend anyone but Arabic and English are the main business languages; however; Indians have derived their onw english after the British left and even I have difficulty understanding many of them. Wen I go to a shope and there is and Indian salesman I have to aske at least three times what he is saying ans this is meant seriously; there are other whose English is wonderful. Most people in Government positions are well versed in English although I have to admit we there are a nuber of employees who speak very little English. You seem to have encountered the very few that don't speak english. May I add this comment here; many more Arabs speak English than English speaking races speak Arabic.	0

Fact : If your company terminates you; take that letter to your bank ; you won't be required to pay any remaining amount ; bank will use its tacts ; don't yield ; after few days of delay ; finally you will get clearance from bank and fly home .. Insurer of your money / bank would pay that amount to bank; may be insurer and bank are having offices in the same building / or managers are cousins / they are after your money / so escape clear from both parties / Pray hard / Good luck in finding another job soon somewhere / Regards.	1

Q206	Q206_R16_C4	What if???? eye contact leads an spark to your heart.....	Is the medical exam result always takes 3 working days? beacuse my colleague did the fingerprinting 2 weeks after his medical exam and he said the medical exam result takes 2 weeks. And the only thing for him to know if he passed the medical exam is because he did the fingerprinting process. And is there anyway to know if you pass the medical exam?	0
Q206	Q206_R16_C5	What if???? eye contact leads an spark to your heart.....	Once you are done w/ ur medical exam you can check w/ the medical commission at least after 3 working days. Just show your receipt number or passport copy at the male counter section and you'll get to know if its ready or not. For a medical employees it usually takes about 2 wks to have the results done due to other test (e.i. creatinine test) that has to be sent to HMC for investigations. In your case; you are only required to undergo blood test(HIV) & Chest X-ray(PTB); so i think it wont take long that much. Dont you have mandoop/representative for your company? he is supposed to follow up all these things and you can always check w/ him. Good Luck!	0
Q206	Q206_R16_C6	What if???? eye contact leads an spark to your heart.....	Thanks Apple for always replying on my post. Another thing; after medical will I immediately go for fingerprinting or it will be for another week or so?	0

Q206	Q206_R16_C8	What if???? eye contact leads an spark to your heart.....	Everyone is checked for Hepatitis C; not just those in medical or food business.

Q206	Q206_R17_C4	What if???? eye contact leads an spark to your heart.....	3 things can be done ; 1) Ask him to write a letter in disagreement to the warning to explain his version of why he shouldnt be issued a Warning Letter. The Warning Letter still sustains as 1st warning and is filed into his P-File. 2) Suspension ; The employee can be suspended from days to weeks; depending on HR policies. 3) Immediate termination ; If the warning is based on safety issues; and the employee refuses to acknowledge the issue; then termination can be in effect as a last resort.	1

Q206	Q206_R17_C7	What if???? eye contact leads an spark to your heart.....	That warning letter will be kept on the concerned employee's files. The company's HR will indicate the date when the letter was served and write a notation on the letter saying that the concerned employee refused to receive it. I hope though that the written warning was being served in accordance with the company's rules and regulations and all employees are aware that such exists.	1
Q206	Q206_R17_C8	What if???? eye contact leads an spark to your heart.....	even if your tear that letter still your out of your chair and go home from where you came from.	0
Q206	Q206_R17_C9	What if???? eye contact leads an spark to your heart.....	The warning letter issued to you is to inform you that you have been forewarned. Rip Cord is correct. The warning still stands unless you issued a written answer why the warning is unacceptable.	0

Q207	Q207_R83_C1	Russians in qatar Are there many Russians; Georgians; Ukrainians or any guys from USSR live in Qatar? Are in Qatar Russian school ? If any one have information; please advise me. Thanks	It is a very rare Qatari man that would want anything more than what you just described. It is a very rare man in Qatar that wants anything more to do with a Western girl than you just described. Meeting men here is like stepping through a minefield. 9 out of 10 of them just want sex. And they will do and say anything to get it from you. I am not bitter; I do not hate men; but I have been living in various parts of Asia for the last 2 and a half years. Trust me when I say if you do not want to get burned be VERY careful who you date. Asian opinion of Western women is not very high when it comes to sex and dating. Tell Sunny to stop advertising online for a date and come here and get the lay of the land first.	0

Q207	Q207_R83_C3	Russians in qatar Are there many Russians; Georgians; Ukrainians or any guys from USSR live in Qatar? Are in Qatar Russian school ? If any one have information; please advise me. Thanks	I must tell you redcajun504 Arab youths can go to any extent to get sex; but so is men from any country. Men have always sex on mind. It is always advisable to be cautious. But why are you worrying? There is a huge expat population here; which includes Indians; Europeans; Americans and even Australians. So; it's not a problem basically. Ask Sunny to be prudent and approach the things casually; without any pre-conceived notions; though caution is utmost required. You never know you may actually get a gem of person among these Arabians. After all; many of them have married Westerners. But dohagirl as such is correct that youths here always look for sex. On my own experience I must tell you they see Russians; Lebanese and Filipinos as someone always available for sex.

Q207	Q207_R83_C4	Russians in qatar Are there many Russians; Georgians; Ukrainians or any guys from USSR live in Qatar? Are in Qatar Russian school ? If any one have information; please advise me. Thanks	Life is not easy if you are a Western Woman; and the main reason a man from this part of the world would want a western woman is mainly for sex. However; please do not for one moment think that the men and women here con't have premarital relationships - they do it just not talked about and it is not caried out in the open. Due to the conservative background of the boys they will always return to their families and it would be vry difficult for them to marry outside the families would not be happy about it. I think it is much better to be very cautious out here although there are a great many handsome men and they can be very charming going through the Arab and Asian world of men they are all interested in SEX. One of the things is that being found to be together whoc ae not married can get into very deep trouble here - just a little food for thought.	0

Thanks	Sadly this has been the case for many years. Maybe it originally stems from the days when arabs had loads of money; visited capital cities (mainly in the West) and were naturally surrounded (as they were rich) by hookers. Word spread when they returned that they had been with western women. The assumption would then be made that all Western women were loose. That is the assumption that we came to many years ago. Rather like the Western men going to Thailand	0

Thanks	Thanks dweller..You have been fair.. DG..your point is sensible..I tried to see if the shoes fit on the other foot..and its same..Ironical?? (LOL...) It is a very rare Western man that would want anything more than what you just described. It is a very rare man in the West that wants anything more to do with a Asian girl than you just described. Its impossible to believe that the thousands of crippled shaking 70 year old Western men moving with 21 year old Asian beauties do so...because the guy was so romantic; loving and responsible that the girl fell head over heals in love with him.. I have seen Western men in various parts of Asia for the last 2 and a half years. Trust me when I say if you do not want to get burned be VERY careful who you date. Western opinion of Asian women is not very high when it comes to sex and dating. Here I actually mean women from China; Phillipines and Thailand..Easy prey for western men..In other countries South Asia and Middle east women are not availabl.....	0

IÂ´ve seen too many fat red drunken western turists around here lately...and you know what; Qataries are much better behaved than that. At least they are rich and handsome; and donÂ´t get completely drunkenly smashed in public; so donÂ´t worry about dating them. Thing is; if you behave like a slut;all men will treat you like a slut.

Yeaaa they also thought the US and nato would bail them out. They aren't just making up this stuff as they go along. Someone is making them promises behind closed doors and breaking them publicly.	0

You ask: By the way what is the actual position of Qtel towards illegal downloading Common cense tells me: If QTEL has not blocked those web sites; I'm not saying Is right or wrong; I keep my neutrality on that issue. Then keep on doing what ever you are doing with torrents. Know by posting the topic in public forum and QL uses the portal of Qtel; then you are risking the possibilities for them blocking them. They do monitor this public web site.

Do the internet providers keep a track of data/movies or anything at all that we download?	Less or more; piracy is everywhere. Don't say that only Indians are doing this. The software you mentioned to download audio/video stuff and books from the internet; certainly would not be from India and the stuff that is copied on Torrents (as I mentioned in an earlier thread) is also not copied by Indians only. Most of the tools to get pirated stuff online are invented in those developed countries where giant software companies are battling against piracy in underdeveloped countries. So; don't blame a particular country. Just fight against Piracy as it is illegal and not good; no matter where is it.

Q208	Q208_R20_C2	How safe is it to download stuff from torrents here? How safe is it to download stuff from torrents here? Do the internet providers keep a track of data/movies or anything at all that we download?	"King is right. Utorrent (www.utorrent.com) is the best and simplest torrent client. Once downloaded you just need to install it and then use the search engine on the top right hand side of the interface to search for whatever you want to download (i.e just type the name of the movie). It will take you the mininova.org and once there it is a good idea to sort the findigs by clicking on the heading SEEDS. This will sort it so the movie or program with the highest number of seeders will show first. This guarantees you a higher speed as ""higher number of seeders = greater speed"". Hope this helps. Other good sites are: demonoid.com torrentz.com torrent.to but the one i use for movies is: www.torrentfive.com"	0

I've been there a few times already; but always in a group of at least 4 cars. I can tell you that some of my friends keep their cars on 2WD mode most of the times. But I consider these guys very experienced as they only needed to use the 4WD mode when getting someone out of trouble. My old boss even had to drive back (in an Isuzu Trooper; mind you) from deep within the inland sea only on 2WD because the gear-box malfunctioned. So; I stand with TB that it can be done but will not risk it myself.	0

Otherwise you may have to go to jail for one to four weeks and then you will be deported. I know a couple of people who have gotten away with it and one person who was deported. You will not get whipped (unless you are a muslim). Good luck. Just call me Tigasin. That's what I'm talking about	0

It all depends on the contractual obligations;however; being a maid; she too deserves rest; a holiday; if not for 3 days atleast for 2 days and on mutual understanding she can come for 2 hours atleast depending on the needs.

I thought it was a bit boring.     Beautiful decorations (heard they cost 60;000QR) ; tables; lots of sweets.   However it got started very very late  (left at11:00pm; dinner had not started)   Out of 300 women in the room I only saw I dress that I liked.   Most were garish and hideously gaudy.   Lots of Bright bright colors; feathers; sequins; etc.    TONS of makeup on.    They had a runway and a couple of women played the drums and wailed Arabic songs rather loudly.   Girls would get up and dance down the runway (so the older women could check them out as possible daugher-in-law contenders I've been told) Finally the lights went down about 10:00 the fog and light show started--sort of like a rock concert!   The bride then came out and walked very slowly down the runway.    Eventually people came up and showered her head with money.  She looked scared to death.  I learned she was 20 years old and had never met her husband-to-be; but had talked to him on the.....	0

Q211	Q211_R2_C8	Dress up night in - any ideas for outfit? Could you please advice shops in Doha to get some outfit for fancy dress party in... Got not much time till weekend really. Ta!	from my experience; no matter how flamboyantly u dress up; its NOTHING compared to the Qatari ladies there. god; they r all so gorgeous; and their way of dressing up is amazing. cant afford (lol) ;)) abt the gift; no u dont take a gift to the wedding. usually i visit them few days after the wedding; n give a gift. wat happens during a weddin? well; make sure u sit away from the loudspeakers placed at all corners of the hall :-)) u can dance if u want; to the arabic songs being played there. hhhmmm;; n the food part; its yummy. u can starve for a few days after that to lose all those calories earned on that one evenin:-) its fun; ENJOY!! PS: oh yeah; like many others mentioned above; dont click any snaps. n thats if ever they let u carry ur mobile phone inside. usually they hold it at the entrance. so be prepared to be disconnected from the rest of the world for the few hours u spent there..	0

Q211	Q211_R2_C10	Dress up night in - any ideas for outfit? Could you please advice shops in Doha to get some outfit for fancy dress party in... Got not much time till weekend really. Ta!	Unfortunately; I have found Qatari weddings to be a bit depressing... I have yet to see it as a joyous occassion... I have been to a few in the last few months; and have been very disappointed.  The ladies seem to be competing with each other in the dress department; and so some outfits are very outlandish... There seems to be so much politics amongs the different groups of ladies sitting at the tables; you know.. this group doesn't like that group; or this part of the family feel snubbed for some reason.... The bride ALWAYS looks terrified and a bit like a geisha girl for all the make- up on her face.  I really feel sorry for her.  One of the brides I saw; took about 30 min to walk down the isle in front of us as I don't think she could move with the dress she was wearing....   And you are right about the mobile thing... I had mine with me in the hall (it had been with me the whole night... I had to answer a phone call; and all of a sudden my phone was snatched out of my.....	0

"Here's the content of the thread; You are probably all aware by now that there are new dress regulations in place in Qatar - the 4 and 5 star hotels were given 10 days to comply with the new rules which are that you must be ""appropriately dressed"" - no explanation of what this is but it seems to be no knees (even at night in nightclubs etc) and no shoulders. I've heard of people being refused entry to restaurants for having slits up their dresses and (in the case of a 14 year old) showing their knees. I've been told the shopping centres are also now turning people away for wearing halter necks etc (Landmark in particular). One friend just rang me to say that a group of her girlfriends were stopped from going into W last weekend - each of them had something ""inappropriate"" from cleavage; to knees to shoulders. You also have to now show either your ID card or passport for entry into bars and (the scary part) if you aren't dressed appropriately they take your ID card and scan it and send ....."	0

I'm all for clamping down on inappropriate clothing in the shopping malls and in public; but I think there should be more leeway when it comes to the hotels. Also; they should have started implementing these rules a decade ago. They've let things go to far to have a hope in hell of policing it properly.	0

What a joke - the clubs and bars were about the only place a girl could look nice and not worry about shoulders; knees and cleavage showing. No offence but anyone who could potentially be offended by short skirts or low cut tops shouldn't be in the clubs anyway. Is Qatar turning into Saudi?

Amoud; maybe not; but if a country is going to allow nightclubs then it has to accept that there's a certain style of dress that comes with them. They seem to want the best of both Worlds; Western trappings with Qatar conservatism. It wont work. They need to decide what they want and stick with it.	0

Ta!	hi Minoush; I think you probably tried these shops already; ie; mothercare;marks and spencer; BHS; Next. Yup selection is awful; and prices are ouch. Have you tried H&M? They did have many trousers; price range was 160-250Qar. The other thing to do would be to invest in good pair of basic colour trousers and get your tops stitched.	0

Haven't tried Mothercare at CC. I hate going there but I may have to... M&S does not have a Maternity section. I don't get this... every local has at least 5 kids; plus every expat seems to be pregnant. Where do they all shop for clothes?	0
Q211	Q211_R4_C3	Dress up night in - any ideas for outfit? Could you please advice shops in Doha to get some outfit for fancy dress party in... Got not much time till weekend really. Ta!	I tried H&M and their selection was ok. The only problem were the pants had this new fangled design where the waist is supposed to sit below your waist and it felt like my pants were about to fall down. Just too hip and cool for me. I'm old and I need mom jeans! :-) I will try BHS. I'm used to Target and discount stores. The idea of paying $80-$100 for a pair of pants that I will wear for 6 months is impossible. Checked online; shipping from Motherhood Maternity from the States is $70 for a ton of clothes. I think I will just do that.... Thanks ladies!

Q211	Q211_R4_C5	Dress up night in - any ideas for outfit? Could you please advice shops in Doha to get some outfit for fancy dress party in... Got not much time till weekend really. Ta!	hi Minoush; you will have to go to Mothercare at CC; because apparently all maternity wear from other MC shops are to shift to MC of CC; if not already there. You need to visit the MC inside Debenhams. The locals wear the abbaya; so a loose gown inside ( the jalabiyas; more like the house maxis) is not visible to anybody. Among Asian clothes there are many loose tops in style right now; with lycra tights; so again no problems there. Getting T's is not an issue; as long as you are okay with it hugging you tight all day. The trouser style; is the low bump style right now; and it doesnt really fall off.H&M had the high waist trousers. not sure about baby shop for Maternity clothes; else you may have to try the large clothes section; like Evans; if you are looking for comfy tops. Check Giordano as well; they dont have maternity; but they usually have these loose comfy linen trousers that you can tie under the bump.	0

I agree - Pretty bad - even worse if you want to buy something for work. H+M are fine if you are looking for casual but that is it.

"The men's part of the wedding is pretty straight forward. Invitees congratulate the groom and his father; brothers... You sit next to him for the traditional coffee and tea; have a picture taken with him. Later on there's a buffet and an ""'ardha"" which is a traditional sword dance. Very nice; beautifully decorated garments. After that groom goes to the women's party and joins the bride. At least these are my first-hand observations. There's no ""down and dirty"" part there."	0

Take a plane and go somewhere else. :-) I'd suggest Heat or Mercury Lounge in Melbourne for RnB/Hip Hop. ;-) (Bit of promotion from an ex-employee) If you still wanna come to the Middle East for clubbing; go to Beirut or Istanbul. Maybe even Cairo for that matter. Or go to Goa; India if you wanna spend Xmas at trance parties on the beaches. Or go pub hopping in Bangalore.

Well I date a Saudi so I have to say he and his friends treat me very respectfully. Yes lot's of them do go to Bahrain on the weekends; but so do a lot of Qataris and Kuwatis. The place is basically crawling with people from the more conservative nations on the weekend. Besides the fact that the number of land cruisers increases and there are more people in the pubs I haven't noticed a difference. As for dress; I can dress less conservatively in Bahrain than here. There are more single women as well so I don't feel like I stand out so much. Bahrani girls don't wear the abaya as much as here and I haven't seen to many in hijab. I doubt she'll notice many stares at all. As for it becoming more conservative; well they are closing down all the bars in the 3 star hotels because that's where all the prosititutes hang out. But my guess is you won't even notice they are gone.	0

Q212	Q212_R37_C2	Doha Airport v/s Doha Malls Are the items inside Doha airport (Duty Free) cheaper compared to those that are sold inside the malls?	Thanks; how awesome; I was thinking it was more like 1.5 hours from what everyone has said about Doha traffic!! :) Being here in the USA is a bit difficult to find out what areas are best to live in Doha... My husband and I love being at home; we prefer high rises with a nice gym though given we are bringing motorcycles over I am thinking somthingh is a garage might be best. We have no kids so schools and having other kids around us is not a top priority. Given this; which areas/buildings would you guys recommend? We don't want to commute more than say 30-40 minutes each way if we can help it (to and from new DOHA airport). What information is there out there about the Pearl; I imagine is still is mostly a huge construction site but are there finished buildigns there worth commuting to and from? Are shoping areas and restaurants nearby already finished? Thanks so much! Kiki	0

Q212	Q212_R37_C4	Doha Airport v/s Doha Malls Are the items inside Doha airport (Duty Free) cheaper compared to those that are sold inside the malls?	"Qatar's property development websites are misleading as most of Qatar itself. What you see is not what you'll get. Lusail is a ""planned new city"" due to open soon but you go there now; all you'll se is an empty desert land with maybe 2 tower cranes. Pearl is nearly completed but with a lot of infrastructure and other nature problems. Both locations are at the north outskirts limits of the city; while the new airport is being built at the southern outskirt limit of the city. You do have to across the whole city and the traffic here is another nightmare (not only the traffic jams but also the aggressive and risk driving local style). If no traffic; it will be a 20-30 minutes drive. The best location for you would be near by the Marriott Hotel. A friendly advice: be prepared for the biggest frustrations you ever experienced at professional and social levels and you won't be disappointed. I wish you all the best!"	0

"Yes I'm from Florida and yes photography pays *some* of our bills ;) Husband got contract to work in Doha so I am thinking the expensive part of living arrangements there will all depend on what his contract stipulates. Thanks for the real estate agent contact mdobrasz; will see if we can start lining up some visits to different areas and take a look at villas vs condo... not sure what is best for us yet. I think given we are going to try to bring our 2 motorcycles a house with a garage will be best... Nic; thanks for the advice; I think we'll probably opt to be closet to airport than to drive 1 hour to get to and from work. So far I have seen very little ""real"" pictures of Doha; mostly plans and projection images of what it *will* look like so we figure we're in for huge construction site in the desert ;)"	0

Q212	Q212_R37_C9	Doha Airport v/s Doha Malls Are the items inside Doha airport (Duty Free) cheaper compared to those that are sold inside the malls?	Hi; I am not actually in Doha yet myself; arriving at the end of this month. The only vehcile imports I have done in Doha previously was for the Oilfield Market; and is done slightly differently. You might be surprised; I seen a couple of big bike shops here in Doha when I visted a few weeks back. Anyhow; in Dubai a few years ago; I imported some choppers from the guys off Discovery Channel program. The Duty was 5% of the CIF Value. (eg. Bike is US $20000 CIF then Duty will be US $1000) I then had to pay a local agent commission on the import of US $1500 each as they held the import licence agreements for the bikes. Therafter; Police Inspection; Registration and other details were approx. $1200 per bike. Then of course you will have standard insurance and road tax; which I believe is approx. $100 per month in Doha. (Someone can correct me if I am wrong) PM me if you need further information; I do work in this field and can get a colleague to check all the ins and outs if required. Have.....	0
Q212	Q212_R37_C10	Doha Airport v/s Doha Malls Are the items inside Doha airport (Duty Free) cheaper compared to those that are sold inside the malls?	My husband is a life-long motorcycle junkie. Got his first when he was about 10 years old. He would never consider riding one here in Doha. Traffic is very dangerous. They have the highest accident rate per capita in the entire world. Check out some you-tube videos showing all the spectacular car crashes in Doha. You have to see it to believe it. Seriously most people see a car crash every single day. Riding motorcycles on the streets in Doha is only for fools in my opinion.	0

The iphone i pretty over rated in my opinion; yeah it's a tidy piece of kit got some cool things; but it is stupidly expensive here; IF i ever get one i will wait till Vodaphone release them (and they will). got to agree with shyampsunder on this one; go with HTC; they have being doing the touch systems for alot of brands of phone for a long time; and now they have their own phone; their features are great; and they are very easy to use. Wish i had one. I use a n95 been using it for over a year now; and it does everything i need it to. ____________________________	0

Q213	Q213_R4_C1	liking and loving can you deferentiate the difference between loving a person and liking a person	Anyone who tells u they can define love is a damn lair. Love isn't something definite and noone can tell u what it is; u can only feel it; and u feel it differently towards different people; I mean u love ur friend in a different way than ur fiancee for example. So in that aspect; yes u can love more than one person at the same time in different ways.	1

I mean people spend years trying to write books about love and relationships but it's all nonsense because no relationship is like another; every relationship has its own dynamic and each love is unique so none of us can define love; we recognize it when we feel it but we can't define it because each one of us feels it differently.

Q213	Q213_R30_C8	liking and loving can you deferentiate the difference between loving a person and liking a person	Dont listen to their nonsense. If you want to marry a Qatari girl; you will first of all need her families approval. After that - you may apply for an approval from higher authorities. The husband isn't; under any circumstance; going to get the Qatari passport if this is accepted and approved. The children will hold the father nationality - and they will not benefit any of the privileges that locals have. Good luck and let me know if you need more information.	1

Does this mean I have to go to immigration to pay the fees?	I am not too sure on all the formailities however; would suggest that you get in touch with your embassy. As far as I know; yor wife needs a RP (residence Permit) which can only be done once you have yours. If she come on the Visit visa; she will only be able to stay a few months and will have no rights (Hospital; Bank account finding a job etc). Not to say that she can not come on the Visit Visa but she would have to leave after the Visa expired and apply for a Residency under your name from her country unless she has her own sponslor in Qatar.	0

Does this mean I have to go to immigration to pay the fees?	You can sponsor your wife only when you have RP (residence permit) in hands. It will take approximately a month for you to get one; from the moment of entry and one more month to do the paperwork for your wife. My suggestion - ask your sponsor now; because they will have to help you with it.	0

Does this mean I have to go to immigration to pay the fees?	Chbck; your wife can come on a company business visa for 3 months renewable 3X. Once you get your RP; you can transfer her sponsorship under you; coz the company will give her No Objection Cert.; She doesn't need to exit and go back to her country. Once you applied for her the business visa; you just need to obtain a supporting affidavit from your embassy that you will shoulder all her expenses during the period. Trust me I did it for my cousin; though her sponsor was transfered to her company; and she got residence now. Good luck!	0

My visa is good enough to get her in when she gets off the plane with nothing more than her passport. 2. She can get any other kind of visas that she needs to get once she's in the country and they won't make her go home. 3. If I leave for Doha on December 9th and she leaves for Doha on December 18th; we will be able to spend Christmas together.

You have to apply the visa first from here (Doha) then send the visa no. to her so; she can print out from the net www.moi.gov.qa ;if she needs a copy. Visa application is just within 2 days(it depends). She just need her passport in the airport here coz her visa details is already in the computer network system in Immigration Doha Airport.

Assuming that you're already in Doha; and you want to bring your wife here very very soon; fortunately; u dont have RP yet. There is still a way for her to come but under any company business visa or a tourist visa (but 28 days only...also 3x renewable from travel agency); then transfered to your sponsor once you got ur RP. And she don't need to go back to her country. For the supporting affidavit; I think the best way is to get from her sponsoring company coz u dont have RP yet that time; right? Peace! just wanna help u out.	0

I tried several times but they refused and saoid come back when three months complete. However you can stay here more than 6 months; your husband can go to immigration and talk with captain he will extend one month more; some time more than one month.Good Luck	0

Is the medical exam result always takes 3 working days? beacuse my colleague did the fingerprinting 2 weeks after his medical exam and he said the medical exam result takes 2 weeks. And the only thing for him to know if he passed the medical exam is because he did the fingerprinting process. And is there anyway to know if you pass the medical exam?	0
Q216	Q216_R55_C5	Eye Test Are there any Eye Test Center in City Center accredited by Trafic Department?	Once you are done w/ ur medical exam you can check w/ the medical commission at least after 3 working days. Just show your receipt number or passport copy at the male counter section and you'll get to know if its ready or not. For a medical employees it usually takes about 2 wks to have the results done due to other test (e.i. creatinine test) that has to be sent to HMC for investigations. In your case; you are only required to undergo blood test(HIV) & Chest X-ray(PTB); so i think it wont take long that much. Dont you have mandoop/representative for your company? he is supposed to follow up all these things and you can always check w/ him. Good Luck!	0

If you have your own way to the school; take them as the drivers are excellent; but they are let down by the disorganization and lack of professionalism of the management.	0

Regd you Jakarta trip; i think we fly the A300 aircraft there and those aircraft's are being converted into freighters; coz they are kinda old. LHR-DOH...cancelled... why?

But i can really tell you that QR Economy class service on these long haul flights was better than the EK J class service. Besides; they always mishandle baggage coz they have a minimum connecting time of i think 1.5 hours; so if your connecting anytime less than that; youu can rest assured; your baggage won't ride the flight you're in. So not the case with QR.	0

Now; its been two days but i am still waiting. Howlong does this procedure take? and what should i do about it if they cant find it? Thanks	Small correction here; Eng & Avid;) Your company can issue you an exit permit; but you will still be blocked by the Immigration at the airport during departure; when your name is blacklisted in the system. If you know that you had previous police case( ex. returned cheque); obtaining exit permit doesn't mean that your name is cleared from the system. You must follow up w/ the capital police after 6-months from the date you settled your case to remove the blacklisted of your name in the Immigration airport.	0

Now; its been two days but i am still waiting. Howlong does this procedure take? and what should i do about it if they cant find it? Thanks	Apple I am not arguing with you. My PRO said when they apply for exit permit it will be directed to interior ministry for endorsement. If there is anything against you; your exit permit will be rejected by the system. it is computerised and we are applying for all our immigration requirements through on-line. To clear the black listing you need to go to public procrcutor's office (NIYAMA) and settle your penalties. (near city centre) and the public procecutors office can clear your record within short time if you aooroch them with your lawyer. This is what our lawyer said.	0

Now; its been two days but i am still waiting. Howlong does this procedure take? and what should i do about it if they cant find it? Thanks	You got good points; and neither i'm not arguing w/ you. I was giving you an example of a police case(ex. returned cheques). Coz this is the common case that can happen to anyone. If your case was filed at Capital Police; you need to clear your name from there. If it was a Court case then you should go to Niyaba. Mostly; the case are to be filed from the Police dept. then forwarded to the court for settlement depends on both the plaintiff & the suspects agreement. Another example is if your bank filed a complaints against you to the capital police for not paying your debts(Car loan; Credit cards; Personal loans); then your name will be blacklist in the system till you settled your accounts. Accordingly; only after 6-months from the date of your settlement before your name is remove from the blacklist. What i'm trying to imply here is; if you know that you had previous but settled criminal or civil cases; nothing wrong to clear your name & follow up at the place where the charges agains.....	0

Thanks	go to the sales center in the arrivals terminal & talk to the sales staff there. almaha only takes bookings prior to 24 hours of the flights; how ever depending on the work load they have a chance of accepting your booking; yet you might have to pay a sum of Qr 300.00 extra to the normal service fee. i too agree with Khanan. she will be able to proceed her self if you are able of instructing her on how to. make sure you give her clear instructions. if she is a bit old; ask her to hire a porter for just Qr 20.00(porter counter is located to the left once you enter the baggage area. it will give you a porter ticket enabling her to hire a porter) which; the porter will locate the bag for her & bring her to you. if you wish to you can tip the porter with another additional amount of your choice. i dont see any point of u wasting about 500-600qr when you can get the work done just in 20qr - 30qr. all the best & wish your mom a pleasant stay in DOH!	0

Thanks	people of 80 years old & more under visit visa clear through immigration; customs check & baggage area without any hassle. one should only fear only if they have issues with their visa. regardless of what visa type a passenger hold. ask your mom to keep her passport; ticket copy (if available) & visa copy ready before she proceed to the immigration area/counter. instruct her on where exactly you live in DOH as the immigration staff may require these information. i personally know people who clear by them selves before almaha does. i bet she can clear by her self. dont waste your money; give your mom some quality time with that money which you are planing to spend on this service which you are looking at.	0

I've often waited three hours at imigration in those airports. Secondly; get yourself a new electronic residency card and you'll breeze straight through.	0

Bringing your favourite stuff will make it seem more like home here. Bringing a car is probably not a good idea.	0

Now; its been two days but i am still waiting. Howlong does this procedure take? and what should i do about it if they cant find it? Thanks	That's the thing Margaret; I've been offered a reasonable shipping allowance. It seems such a waste though (financially and moreover environmentally); to ship the basic practical stuff. I'm not particularly attached to 'things' in any event. My most favourite things are my friends and my memories. I can't ship my friends over in a tea-chest; although some may come to visit; and my memories are mostly in my head; although some are also recorded in photo form; and I wouldn't want to entrust my most dearly loved photos to a shipping company. I've never been particularly materialistic and so my favourite 'stuff' amounts to a few trinkets and things bought on my travels; shoes (but I'm going to limit myself as to how many pairs I bring over; because I want to -- and can -- travel light). I particularly like a lamp; a few pictures and paintings; my Le Creuset pans (although they are so stupidly heavy I wouldn't dream of shipping them half way across the world). I can live without those thoug.....	0

The whole of it went in one go! Serious we went through such a nightmare shipping items - we packed about twenty boxes full of dvds; clothes;and books! Then it took about SIX month to come though customs! We brought our tv over but that got broken! serious i would take as little as you can with you; books yes the decent ones are so hard to find out here; dvds if you watch them yes;clothes for sure! other bits id say no! theres amazing furniture; kitchen bits; bathroom bits out here you can get anything you need! Sentimental things - i would say no purely becuase they might get lost on there way over - photos and such for sure; letters for sure but the big things no! i really wish we had brought with us half of what we did;we brought too much stuff; we have accumulated even more and when we move on i hate to think how many boxes we will have to pack. try and pack as little as you can you can get anything out here excpet good books! hope this he.....	0

Now; its been two days but i am still waiting. Howlong does this procedure take? and what should i do about it if they cant find it? Thanks	Blankets. During the UK summer I find even the lightest duvet is too warm and I prefer to use a cotton waffle blanket. Friends who had lived in the middle east advised me that with the air-conditioning I would need a duvet here. They were wrong. We keep our air-co at 25 degrees and I miss my blanket. I can't find cotton waffle blankets here; only nasty fleece ones. The choice of duvet covers isn't too good either - too expensive or too tacky - especially since bhs went up in smoke. It got pretty cold in the winter. Bring an electric fire. Plastic food containers are generally of poor quality and you need to keep dry food sealed up or the bugs will get in.	0

Now; its been two days but i am still waiting. Howlong does this procedure take? and what should i do about it if they cant find it? Thanks	Thank you for your suggestions so far; they're really useful. @ The truth: I was planning on bringing as little as possible anyway; but I wouldn't have thought about a Skype phone (thanks the truth). @ charmed: Luckily; charmed; I don't have a dog; I did have a cat but I had to re-home her about two years ago when I went to France for a few months. And the length of time it takes to clear stuff is the other problem. Even if I did want to ship some practical household items; I would surely have bought some replacements by the time my own were shipped and cleared customs! @ Squarepeg: Blankets -- that's an interesting point; squarepeg; I mostly have duvets and throws at home; but I might get some blankets. Do the a/c units work as heaters too? I recall that when I lived overseas before; the a/c units also worked as heaters; do they have similar units in Doha? I don't think I'll ship an electric fire but I'll probably bring my hot water bottle; thanks. And bugs? How big are these bugs? *s.....	0

Now; its been two days but i am still waiting. Howlong does this procedure take? and what should i do about it if they cant find it? Thanks	I didn't see many bugs; so I stored some dried food in plastic bags with the tops rolled over. I was in the UK for a couple of months in the summer and when came back I found weevils in the flour; rice etc. I threw it away and invested in some plastic containers with good seals. Haven't noticed any bugs in the kitchen since. To be honest; I've had more problems with ants in the UK than I've had with bugs here. Here; we have a bug man who comes and sprays around the house onece a month. There's an earlier thread on this subject somewhere in the archives; I think. I think I'm right in saying that a/c units here generally don't also work as heaters. Certainly in our house they just cool.	0

Just speak to him and tell him its not tolerable since u have school going kids at home and if it continues then u would complain to the higher authorities. Good Luck!!!	0

Q219	Q219_R5_C4	Platao... and those are some pics of MY aquarium..:( don't my cute fishes look sad and lost??? :(:(:( what shoudl i do?? how can i get rid of this green hell??? :(:(	The reason behind most non-muslims who have converted was only to marry a Muslim girl. They know that they cannot have her any other way; unless she sins; and not all do. Yes she should accept the man for who he is and for what he believes in; but us as Muslim females - we are restricted to standards and we cannot change them. Its too complicated to discuss; but good luck. Take more time to learn Islam and maybe the faith in Allah will grow in your heart - not for HER (the girl-friend) but for Allah himself.	0

This is common problem as this hospital. I have heard of people waiting more than 1 hours for scheduled appointments. Scheduling the appointment is often difficult and disorganized also. Hopefully if enough complain they will improve; but best solution is for new private hospitals to open to create competition.	0

Please let us know; if al ahli responds back to your suggestion form; because my experience is that they have a lousy customer service and are not interested in following up on the complaint.

You can schedule an appointment in the outpatient clinics at HMC; 3rd floor and I recommend Dr. Ali Raheel or Wanees Ibrahim (both UK board certified).

You need a valid health card (otherwise you'll have to pay more). Then you schedule an outpatient appointment at the counters (there in the HMC outpatient clinics) and they'll give you the date. It doesn't take much to take an appointment (but you'll probably wont get it the same day). Let me ask you quick question? What allergies do you suspect to have? Dust mites? Specific food or animals? pollen? Also do you have asthma ?	0

Who asked you to go for an MRI; that doctor can give a referral for hamad hospital; requesting a MRI. Appointment can take upto a month. I don't think it's necessary for the phc dr to give a referral or that you need to check again with a dr at hamad. I had a referral once directly from A private clinic for an MRI. but rules change. You can check with the dr you are following up your problem with; ask him or her for a referral and then go to hamad hospital X-ray MRI unit and check about the appointment. They are usually helpful; and if they appear uncooperative; please complain since their customer service takes such things seriously; but I don't think you will get such a problem. Their staff is usually helpful; sometimes it can take more than 3 staff members to give you the right picture but they will try and help you and guide you.	0

May Allah gives you good health. In order to get any service from HMC; you need a Health card.

I applied for family visa and unfortunately it was rejected even i have all the criteria;i am sending sms to meet the committee but the reply i received is ""you cannot make appointment with the committee;go to immigration dept"" why?"	Secure a health card if you have not done so already by visiting the Health Center of your area with a pp size photograph and QR 100. (Of course you need to be an RP holder to be eligible) It might take a couple of days or even more to be with you. With that in hand visit your local health center again and see any GP with your complains; let him refer you to some specialist in Hamad related to your complain. Take an appointment of the specialist in Hamad. If luck is by your side and depending on the specialization you have been referred to; it might take somewhere between 1 to 6 months before you could see the specialist. Last time when I was there to take an appointment for evening clinic (not free even with health card); I was told that the appointment system itself is being upgraded and no appointment is possible until January next year. So watch out. Now if you are really lucky and you get to see the specialist and he feels that you need an MRI Scan done; he will issue you a paper .....	0

I applied for family visa and unfortunately it was rejected even i have all the criteria;i am sending sms to meet the committee but the reply i received is ""you cannot make appointment with the committee;go to immigration dept"" why?"	Hi flexicode; you can see a doctor at hamad without going through the health centre. I have had two appointments with different doctors and one for my family member; by directly asking for an appointment.ofcourse you don't get the appt immediately; depending upon the doctor; some specialists are available within a week's time; while renowned consultants have a std waiting period of 45 days; miss that appt and the next one is after another 45 days.grrrr;downside of waiting to meet a consultant is that if he is on a casual leave on the day of the appointment; they don't inform you and some junior dr will see you; beats the point of actually taking an appt with a consultant and then waiting to see him. It helps if you have a referral and a referral by a private dr should be fine too. Most important is to have a health card;once you have applied; they issue you a receipt; you can use the hospital services with the receipt.	0

I applied for family visa and unfortunately it was rejected even i have all the criteria;i am sending sms to meet the committee but the reply i received is ""you cannot make appointment with the committee;go to immigration dept"" why?"	I must add that they keep changing their rules so one month you can get an appt over the phone and the next month they would ask you to go to the phc first for a different appt. Moreover getting an MRI done outside could cost almost 1500 or more;depending upon the area being scanned. But it depends on how worried you are about your condition; and the cost is nothing; you get your results quickly; but if you can wait; its better to get into the national health care system; its not costly; and let them take care of you. Hope you feel well soon.	0

Firstly thank you all for the quick and informative responses. Nobody has actually ASKED me to get an MRI; but I want to do it myself as I am worried about my back. My lower back has been aching me for about 2 weeks now; and yesterday the upper right side of my back starting hurting. I visited a Doctor and he instantly told me that it is NOT a slipped disc; and is just a muscle spasm as the pain doesn't extend to my legs; though I still want to be certain as I want to start working out again; but I don't want to mess with my back if I shouldn't. And he said the upper back pain was also normal; and not related to a slipped disc whatsoever. Thanks again!	0

I applied for family visa and unfortunately it was rejected even i have all the criteria;i am sending sms to meet the committee but the reply i received is ""you cannot make appointment with the committee;go to immigration dept"" why?"	Hello; sad to hear about your back pain. Your dr is right; if your pain is not extending to your limbs and are not feeling any pain or numbness in your fingers or toes; feet; then you don't need to worry. It's possible that you have injured yourself during your workout or is due to your work position; the way you sit at your desk; the way you sit while driving etc. Slip disc would give you excruciating pain; even simple tasks can become difficult; I am not sure if slip disc is the same as disc bulge; but in a disc bulge; if it starts touching the nerve; then you can have crazy tingling pain. You can try asking for an appointment with a dr.arun at hamad hospital in the evening clinic; or try to meet him at alkhor hospital. He is available in Doha only on Tuesday the other days; he is in alkhor.waiting time can be long; because he quite sought after. You can also meet dr.bhat at Doha clinic; he is one of the best and a longtimer in Doha. I would advice you to refrain from weight training.....	0

Hey han19; Thank you so much for the reply; and the advice. I feel so much better knowing that it hopefully most likely is NOT a slipped disc. Being so young; and having started a new career; it would really not be a good thing. I have stopped weight training completely for now which sucks; but do you think it would be a good idea to introduce it very mildly? You think jogging is okay? I want to meet a proper Doctor; even if at a private hospital; as the guy at Hamad was busy; and only barely gave me any advice. I am sure a proper doctor can give me advice as to how exactly the right position is to sleep; to sit; etc. Maybe can give me some exercises to do to help me recover faster. You know any Doctor; even at a private hospital you specifically would recommend? These problems are to do with the Radiology section is that right? Forgive me as I know VERY little about hospitals and such problems; as I have had very few problems in the past (touch wood). Thank you again	0

Hi Hmd; I would not advice you to do any strength training till you back pain subsides. Are you a heavy person. Brisk walking is preferred to jogging as in jogging you are putting a lot of impact on your lower back; as well as our knees. If you are a heavy person then you shuld try to avoid jogging n skipping.brisk walk is great again body posture is important. The stomach muscles support the back; so you need to firm up our stomach. A good physiotherapist can suggest some basic exercises; especially for the back and they really help. They are very simple; if you are into exercises u should know the cobra posture; cat stretch; simple leg lifts while lying down. For sitting position try to google office ergonomics and they usually have a standard picture that shows how one should be seated at an office desk. Wile driving; if you drive long distance; you need to move your neck frequently. You may call Doha Clinic hospital; and ask for Dr. Bhat; he is very good and his treatment is usuall.....	0

I've asked my friend to take a video of me while sleeping; and there you could see that I was gasping for air during sleep. Really scary! It seems I was dying. Sometimes even; I wake up sitting up with no recollection of it. From my research; It was sleep apnea; and I need a sleep study to be prescibed for a CPAP machine.	0

I applied for family visa and unfortunately it was rejected even i have all the criteria;i am sending sms to meet the committee but the reply i received is ""you cannot make appointment with the committee;go to immigration dept"" why?"	do not use kerosene or oil heaters in your home. carbon monoxide is the number one winter killer. Also if you use any space heater keep all drapes and linens a minimum of 3 feet away on all sides. never plug a space heater into a power strip; only directly into the wll to prevent high current draw from melting insulation and starting a fire; These things are dangerous even with proper precautions so at least read the warnings and heed them.	0

Good info tyler the first thing that came to mind for me was to plug the heater directly into the wall because the extension cords/plugs cannot handle the power and will burn out or cause a fire!!

I do not know what styles are available; however the stand alone ones that look like old radiators are sealed steam heaters and you can also buy the small electric heaters in which you can physically see the coils and they blow air via a fan across the coils. Personally you should just have a warm body to curl up with. If it is too cold for one get a second and snuggle up. Skin on skin is the best way to stay warm and transfer body heat. A 3 dog night is darn cold but on that same evening a one woman night may cause perspiration.	0

Just buy a new replacement plug and repair the existing cord. Next step is to make sure the outlet is installed properly and then verify the rating on the breaker. Don't trust the wiring in the house until you pull the wall plate and check the wire size and termination. Not the best electrical work is being done in the new construction; always verify.

Is the medical exam result always takes 3 working days? beacuse my colleague did the fingerprinting 2 weeks after his medical exam and he said the medical exam result takes 2 weeks.

I applied for family visa and unfortunately it was rejected even i have all the criteria;i am sending sms to meet the committee but the reply i received is ""you cannot make appointment with the committee;go to immigration dept"" why?"	Once you are done w/ ur medical exam you can check w/ the medical commission at least after 3 working days. Just show your receipt number or passport copy at the male counter section and you'll get to know if its ready or not. For a medical employees it usually takes about 2 wks to have the results done due to other test (e.i. creatinine test) that has to be sent to HMC for investigations. In your case; you are only required to undergo blood test(HIV) & Chest X-ray(PTB); so i think it wont take long that much. Dont you have mandoop/representative for your company? he is supposed to follow up all these things and you can always check w/ him. Good Luck!	1

My three-year-old boy is at Starfish Lane. He loves it; and I haven't heard any complaints from other parents. My only problem is that it's across town (near Landmark); so I have a long trip in the morning. When we arrived in Doha; we thought we were going to put Jamie into Tots Corner; which is very close to our house. It was full; and so were all of the nearby nurseries; so we went looking for a good nursery anywhere in Doha; and came across Kimberley; one of the owners. Now; I wouldn't change nursery - Jamie's settled into a routine and has his bunch of pals. -- http://all-abroad.blogspot.com/	1

ASD does not start until 4 years old; DESS is having interviews for places now; but it is very hard to get a place with a sibling or British passport (and even then; rather hard). DESS is excellent; however. Compass is worth a look; as it following an international/British curriculum. I have heard good things also about Doha College and Park House for parents looking for a British curriculum.	1

If you are planning to go back to America; then ASD is your best option; because; as far as I know; it is the only school that follows a US curriculum. Their website is very informative. ASD is where most American children go to school; including embassy-related children. They do not start until pre-k (four years old); so looking for a good preschool is probably your best option and then enrolling your child in ASD for the following. Space is limited for Pre-K; and so my understanding is that applying on the first day possible is important--this is usually a day in the autumn; but the website can help. In terms of good preschools; there are several; and where you live will make a difference. There are MANY threads on this side with parents discussing the merits of each. I have heard very good things about Appletree and Starfish. Joining Doha Moms is a good resource too; even if just until you settled.

There are several good nursery schools with English as the primary language around Doha. My son when he was preschool age attended Mulberry Bush and then Doha English Speaking Kindergarten. A good friend of mine owned and ran these places but I don't think she still has Mulberry Bush. DESK was good though; my son enjoyed getting out of the house and making his own friends there. It's been a few years so I don't know about any of the teachers; etc that might still be there; or if my friend Louise Al Jaidah still owns the place; but you can call and find out. Good luck!	1

It is not like England over here. Avoid in house food too. Too many 'support staff' from third world countries that don't wash their hands. Only go with British run ones and then I would check out the number of 'cheap labor' staff they had. Look at is this way; if you were paying a lot of money for a supposed decent Nursery; you would expect the staff to be trained. Over here we don't have that. Most of them have 'degrees' from a Mickey Mouse University. They say they have degrees in Nursing; Education and Admin. Most can't speak English. Really do your research; it is crap over here with the number of third world people who say they have degrees and then don't even know what they are supposed to be talking about. They are desperate for jobs and will lie to get one. They don't care at all that your kid’s education may be hindered by them lying. Just be careful.	0

If you want anything close to a garden you will have to most likely get on an older compound or a stand-alone. You can still get nice villas on older compounds but they don't seem to be building large gardens with new compounds...very tight. And the others are right as well -- 3bed/2bath minimum and about 15;000/month. ************************************* Be kinder than necessary; for everyone you meet is fighting some kind of battle.	0

Well thanks for all your replies - you are a helpful lot I can see this forum is going to be a lifeline to me!

My husband has been out for a trip already and says that there are really no horrible places to live in Doha at al! An older or stand alone villa sounds like the bext chance of having a garden attached. I will have a look at all the recommended websites this evening - many thanks again for all your replies	0

What is the approximate rental cost?	30QR per hour seems to be the standard charge for private arrangements for house cleaning here in Doha plus you might have to pay a transportation charge too depending where she/he is coming from - hopefully you will find someone local in Al Khor! Most cleaners here are either Philipino's; Sri Lankans or Indonesians. I have a Philli lady and she is very thorough. Speaking English reasonably well also helps! Why would you want someone 6 hrs a day 3 times a wk? Unless you also want someone for child minding. My cleaning lady does top and bottom of our 3 bed villa in 3 hours and does a good job. She comes twice a week mostly to get rid of the dust that continually seeps in from all cracks n crevices! LOL We do outsource ironing though and I do our washing! If you can find a good laundry service in Al Khor it should be quite cheap and satisfactory! Ours pick up and deliver too. Good luck in your search and hope this helps!	0

Thanks for your help. I too have someone that comes in around 3 hours ; twice a week. However; I find that is only enough time to do the floors; bathrooms; and a little dusting. My house is a 4 bedroom; 4 bathrooms. I know we have overpaid him for years but was alright with doing so. However; with that being said how no idea how much one charges per hour. He can't come anymore then he does now. Again thanks!	0

Hi Novita77; I don't know exactly how much it is the beverly hills but I think it wont be less than 13;000.

Hi All. I used Mr. Kabeer for my recent move within Doha. His price was very reasonable; a third of the price of the major moving companies. They packed everything up for me. I had to organise my own boxes which I did from QMart at the Mall; and they put all my stuff into them for me. They were quite careful with my stuff and no serious damage was incurred; but I had to supervise that they packed the fragile items carefully; and instruct them on what to put in each box. I strongly recommend him; but as with any move; supervise that the valuables and fragiles items are packed carefully or even better; by yourself. Also; be on hand to manage the packing.	0

After reading your comments; I thought I'd give Mr Kabeer a ring yesterday. He arranged to come over... and I waited for 5 hours for him. When I tried to ring him to find out where he was; he didn't answer - I called four times. Then today he rang and said he was outside my place - apart from the fact that I'm working today and he's 24 hours late.... Hardly reliable; so just as well I'm not taking him On the upside; I tried Runway International. They turned up on time; took 10 minutes assessing everything and asking all the right questions... they may be more expensive than Kabeer; but at least they'll show up!	0

Q222	Q222_R30_C2	Cost of a reasonable 3 bedroom villa What is the trend in rent costs in doha? I am seeking a 3 /4 bedroom unfurnished villa (independant) villa. What is the approximate rental cost?	Wow; that is alot of money. Depending on where you stay as cost of renting an apartment varies on location and type. IF you get a room; sometimes it costs 2000~4000 for villa around old airport area. Those slightly better conditioned apartment flat like 2 bedroom ones maybe around 7500~13000 like holidayvilla service apartment. Water and Electric bill probably around 300 or less. Phone bill local is cheap+internet if you get a package maybe less than 500 per month (this includes the special TV package) If you can secure an accomodation like now in some hotel cum apartments you might get a good deal for a period of a year rental as this is when less people visit Qatar. Next is your transport. Assume you rent a car (think about buying later on); on average a decent car probably cost from 1600 to 2000. Fuel cost probably is around less than 200 per month if it is general travel within Doha to and from work with occassional travel in the weekend. As for the rest; it depends on what you wan.....	1

What is the approximate rental cost?	should be making more than 20;500 per month. But that salary is certainly enough to live well on and to save quite a bit on (assuming you won't have a lot of other expenses). Benefits? No taxes! free furnished housing (probably doesn't include utilities -- check on this) free LOCAL medical (note that this is ONLY for local govt. clinics and Hamad Hospital; not the better private clinics in town where folks speak English; and it will NOT cover you when you return to your home country of origin in the summer -- be warned! It should also include free schooling for any kids you have (you don't say if you have any) -- and again; tuition here varies widely; so you need to know their cap on the dollar/riyal amount because I am SURE they would never pay to send your kids to the American School or something that cost more than; say; QR 25;000/year. Here's where some extra expenses might figure into the mix... So; not bad; but that salary is rather low for a PhD.	0

You can go to 5 star restaurants and pay 300 Riyals for a meal or go to the shwarma shops and other more simple restaurants and pay less than 30 Riyals.

Q224	Q224_R33_C1	Usernames How people choose their usernames in social media? Does they reflect their personalities? If QL give you a chance what would be your next username?	I remember my Eid childhood. It was great. We'd first meet up at my grandfather's home. We'd all talk and the children would plan 3ayuding. We'd all go from house to house; sing a song and look cute and be given 1 riyal. After going door to door; we'd go back home and play until it was time to eat the large feast. Parents would usually chat. Families get together. People visit and they have some tea and snacks. We pray. I love Eid! __________________________ Cost of Living; Visas; Safety Info; Tips on Moving; Facts; Pictures; Videos; and more!	0

Q224	Q224_R33_C4	Usernames How people choose their usernames in social media? Does they reflect their personalities? If QL give you a chance what would be your next username?	Oh Oryx; you are so right! Ramadan should be a month of less (material things) and more (spirituality). For a lot it is. Our schedules do not change much (eg. we do not eat all night which negates the point of fasting in my opinion). We break our fast at sunset with a small light meal. Then we have dinner in the evening. We get up before dawn for a small breakfast. We try to be better Muslims in this month...in the hope we can carry this on throughout the year. I do see Qatar changing from when I was a child during Ramadan. This is something to do with us; of course; and also the influx of expats. _______________________________________________________ Love is the answer...	0
Q224	Q224_R33_C5	Usernames How people choose their usernames in social media? Does they reflect their personalities? If QL give you a chance what would be your next username?	We tend to do a bit of baking prior to Eid. Usually the night before (or earlier if you're really organised) we gather the kids around and make some biscuits and traditional sweets. These are then ready to distribute during the Eid prayer and also to the neighbours. They are also really handy when people come to visit you during Eid. What I've noticed here in Qatar is that friends and neighbours seem to visit each other a lot more on Eid than back home. I guess it's because we don't have family here; so our friends tend to become our new support structure. On the 2 Eids that I've so far spent in Qatar our 'new' tradition seems to be going to City Centre and getting some good sale items! LOL I guess that's our variation on spending the day at the park (too hot) or visiting the grandparents (too far) or staying at home (too boring).	0

Q224	Q224_R43_C5	Usernames How people choose their usernames in social media? Does they reflect their personalities? If QL give you a chance what would be your next username?	I wear an abayya sometimes; the other day when i was wearing it (i just didnt feel like being looked at) without the face thing; several cars were following me! they were guys with beards inside; i dont know if they were flirting or not because afterwards someone told me that foreign women wearing an abayya are usually prostitutes!! i like to think i can pass for an arab... now i'm not sure whether i want to risk it or not. it was so ironic...	0

Q224	Q224_R43_C8	Usernames How people choose their usernames in social media? Does they reflect their personalities? If QL give you a chance what would be your next username?	I think there is a lot of misconceptions gooing on around here. I dont think anyone over here gets offended if someone wears an abaya or a thobe.

Q224	Q224_R43_C9	Usernames How people choose their usernames in social media? Does they reflect their personalities? If QL give you a chance what would be your next username?	You can wear white cotton underwear; a white hat and a thobe. Make sure that they are ironed & clean. For females; I recommend abayas that are put on the head not on shoulders. You could cover your ears; neck; & all hair.I also recommend that you cover your face if you feel unsafe.	0

"... but locals are obliged to wear it. I was told at work that they even get an allowance to wear the costume (not sure from the company or the state). They are not supposed to wear anything else while in Qatar. It is sort displaying that you belong to a certain race when you're in a minority situation; and i'm not going into the VIP territory again. As for western women wearing it; as long as you're not walking ""alone""; it should be OK. At the least you should be walking with another woman; preferably wearing the same. If you two get into a Landcruiser at the end of your walk; that's even better :) Moudir"	0

Q225	Q225_R39_C7	I wanna laugh!!!!!!!!!!!!! Morniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing Drop your jokes here! thanks	without government approval of your marriage; you won't get a family visa back into Qatar; unfortunately. Marrying you out of the country can cause major problems for your fiance; so I would suggest you wait until your marriage is approved. The only other option is that you relocate somewhere else; marry there; but your marriage will not be valid in Qatar; and you will have no claim to any inheritences if god forbid; something should happen to him. Does your fiance not have some Wasta; that can obtain your release from your company? I am not saying that will make things any easier; since you still need to have the govt approval for marriage; but at least you can be in Qatar; near him.	0

There are no longer any bars except the Rugby Club that are not attached to Hotels as far as I know. You have to show your ID card to get into lisenced premises here so not sure how it will work with a visitor visa. It is definitely illegal not only to import alcohol but also consume alcohol in any public place and also be drunk in public.

Nowehere as good as Schoffer Hoffer but a good compromise considering you're in an almost dry nation. So if you're a SH fan like me; drink your fill before you come over. I remember that terrible desperation when Dan Murphy's stopped stocking this beer in Melbourne. After a brief search I found it at Vintage Liquors (Coles). You can get your share of euro lagers as mentioned by previous posters. As a true blue Aussie; I'm sure you'd understand if I said I can piss better than a Bud and won't touch Fosters with a stick. VB; Guinness and Kilkenny can be found here too. Sadly no XXXX or Carlton Cold. If you're feeling adventurous or want to slum it; try Kingfisher Strong. As an Indian I'd also recommend the regular Kingfisher (American style macro lager). Not similar to the one that can be purchased in Oz. That's made in New Zealand under license.	0

Qatari femme; 2 things are wrong with what you said; #1 of course its not a problem in terms of numbers because US population is 300 times bigger than Qatar and; as the article mentions; this only is between the 250;000 Qatari's. The percentage of the obese people is where the problem is around 40% of Qatari men are obese and around 45% of Qatari women are obese!

Now now...let's not hound Qatari-femme for her comments. Statistics apart; obesity is a serious problem; be it the US ; Qatar; India or elsewhere. Gone are the days when children would beg parents to let them go outdoors and play with friends. All that kids want to do these days are update Facebook pics; play console game and order in fast food. The first step is self-awareness. As Gadarene correctly mentions; accepting that there is a problem is very important. No amount of research; pills; diet programs and goading is going to help unless a person or family sits down and takes serious note of his/her/their current health condition. Simple solutions can make a very big difference: 1. Cook healthy food at home don't order in; 2. use healthy cooking medium like canola and sunflower oil; 3. reduce/cut intake of artery clogging food such as margarine; fatty cuts of meat; deep fried food; fizzy drinks; junk fast food; 4. eat appropriate quantities at fixed intervals; 5. encourage and parti.....	0

My parents started giving us beer when we were about 14. We had whiskey when were about the same age; but for a teenager it isn't really that nice. In summer it was gin and tonics; and wine too. We didn't have vodka in the house; but it's good for teens because you can mix it with juices and soft drinks. In my opinion consuming the infrequent alcoholic beverage is a much better option than giving your kids soft drinks; chips; chocolate; sweet snacks; candy and burgers on a daily basis. Obesity and its related illnesses pose a much bigger threat to public health than alcohol abuse.	0

I've been so stressed over my dog being sick that I've lost 5 pounds in 5 days... Yep counting calories and exercise works; but...what you ladies have to remember is that men lose weight faster and easier than women do. Its the estrogen in our bodies that fight the weight loss. God made it so that we would always have that extra reserve in case there was a time of starvation or deprivation; so that we could maintain our bodies to have babies... If you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous; he will not bite you; that is the main difference between a dog and man. -Mark Twain-	0

Ayurveda has guidelines about dietary habits...like: # In the evening avoid heavy foods such as meat; fish; yoghurt; cheese; buttermilk and fromage frais. # Avoid eating between meals. Instead drink hot water; or if necessary eat ripe sweet fruit. # Avoid reheated or stale food. # Most of one's food should be cooked; as the body can more easily absorb cooked food. Raw food should be eaten only as a side dish (e. g. salad). # Make use of culinary spices. They not only make the food tasty; but support the digestive processes as well. # Include all 6 tastes in each meal: sweet; sour; salty; pungent; bitter; and astringent. The tastes also have their own influence on the subtle inner balance of the physiology. # During meals you may sip liquids such as water; juice or lassi. Do not drink a lot and avoid ice-cold drinks - they dampen down the digestive processes. # Milk should not be drunk with the main meal. It can be taken alone or with a light meal of sweet tasting foods (e.g. toast; cer.....	0

Carbohydrate rich food is not combined with acidic food items. eg if you take bread and lemon juice together; it will cause the digestive system to erratically digest both the items. Don't eat grain; cereal or pulses item with acidic items like citrus fruits; grapes; pineapple etc. Protein rich food items go well with low-carb food items like rice and vegetable. Vegetables also go well with all types of starchy; carbohydrate rich food items. Fruits should ideally be taken as a separate meal; independent of other regular meals. Milk and meat is bad combination. Never take milk and meat in a single meal. Separate intake of milk and meat by at least four hours. Milk and meat is good for body in several ways. When taken together; it becomes toxic. Many modern food styles fly on the face of this Ayurvedic food combination rule. Milk is also to be taken warm. Cold milk can cause indigestion. Taking milk too hot also is not desirable. Ending the meals with sweet dessert is not allowed in Ayur.....	0

Yup selection is awful; and prices are ouch. Have you tried H&M? They did have many trousers; price range was 160-250Qar.

Q228	Q228_R8_C2	Plus sizes clothes Dear all; Can you please advice where in Doha can you find plus sized clothes; apart from Splash and Evans?	Haven't tried Mothercare at CC.

Q228	Q228_R8_C3	Plus sizes clothes Dear all; Can you please advice where in Doha can you find plus sized clothes; apart from Splash and Evans?	I tried H&M and their selection was ok. The only problem were the pants had this new fangled design where the waist is supposed to sit below your waist and it felt like my pants were about to fall down. Just too hip and cool for me. I'm old and I need mom jeans! :-) I will try BHS. I'm used to Target and discount stores. The idea of paying $80-$100 for a pair of pants that I will wear for 6 months is impossible. Checked online; shipping from Motherhood Maternity from the States is $70 for a ton of clothes. I think I will just do that.... Thanks ladies!

Q228	Q228_R8_C5	Plus sizes clothes Dear all; Can you please advice where in Doha can you find plus sized clothes; apart from Splash and Evans?	hi Minoush; you will have to go to Mothercare at CC; because apparently all maternity wear from other MC shops are to shift to MC of CC; if not already there. You need to visit the MC inside Debenhams. The locals wear the abbaya; so a loose gown inside ( the jalabiyas; more like the house maxis) is not visible to anybody. Among Asian clothes there are many loose tops in style right now; with lycra tights; so again no problems there. Getting T's is not an issue; as long as you are okay with it hugging you tight all day. The trouser style; is the low bump style right now; and it doesnt really fall off.H&M had the high waist trousers. not sure about baby shop for Maternity clothes; else you may have to try the large clothes section; like Evans; if you are looking for comfy tops. Check Giordano as well; they dont have maternity; but they usually have these loose comfy linen trousers that you can tie under the bump.	1

"Well; will tell you that they have a River Island; Topshop & Wallis (Which r NOT in the other malls) Seems to be very high street. The NEXT store is better and they also have a small home accessory section. The best selling point of that Mall is that it is alot quiter than the others so you can get a better service plus there is no where to ""HANG OUT""except starbucks so that limits those just hanging out to stare at people.

Q228	Q228_R33_C3	Plus sizes clothes Dear all; Can you please advice where in Doha can you find plus sized clothes; apart from Splash and Evans?	I went for the first time to Ezdan today and what a complete and utter piece of trash it is. The finishings in Tower 3 were atrocious. How could the builder let this happen? The building is relatively new and already broken tiles; filthy cielings and walls. The wall tiles are still filthy from the worthless masoners who installed them. Typical old Doha masonry. Paint around the light switches; paint on the trim; careless finishing throughout. PLASTIC MOLD DOORS?!?! How cheap can they be?? Seriously I would not pay 2000 QR a month for any these crap dwellings. Filthy windows; CHEAP CHEAPO CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP a thousand times over. All this and I can believe people actually live in this skunkhole. TRASH TOP TO BOTTOM. I have seen better in the older buildings near Musheirib	1

Q228	Q228_R33_C5	Plus sizes clothes Dear all; Can you please advice where in Doha can you find plus sized clothes; apart from Splash and Evans?	that's true. Finishing sucks; as elsewhere in Qatar. Furniture is not brand new; but at least comfortable and clean. Lighting is dull in the appartments... Kitchen is too tiny...Windows are small and dirty; but now they started to clean them. To cover all these negative points they provide the best gym and swimming pool in Doha; free of charge for tenants. Free cabel and Internet; free shuttle bus from your Tower to City Center; so you don't have to spend hours trying to find parking there. Housekeeping 2 times per week; full maintenance service. Small cafe in the Towers - you can enjoy a fresh coffee in the mornings; the sea food restaurant...Small play area for kids with slides and swings. All this is very helpful for the family with kids - especially housekeeping:)! Pesonnel is friendly and professional.	0

I mean.. really.... most people are trying to sleep.... I would think it would make sense to do it during the week. I have a 1 bedroom (livingroom; kitchen; bedroom and 2 bath) on a 2 month contract. Honestly; I think its overpriced (and Im only on the 6th floor). But other than that... its pretty decent.	1

Q228	Q228_R34_C7	Plus sizes clothes Dear all; Can you please advice where in Doha can you find plus sized clothes; apart from Splash and Evans?	without government approval of your marriage; you won't get a family visa back into Qatar; unfortunately. Marrying you out of the country can cause major problems for your fiance; so I would suggest you wait until your marriage is approved. The only other option is that you relocate somewhere else; marry there; but your marriage will not be valid in Qatar; and you will have no claim to any inheritences if god forbid; something should happen to him. Does your fiance not have some Wasta; that can obtain your release from your company? I am not saying that will make things any easier; since you still need to have the govt approval for marriage; but at least you can be in Qatar; near him.	0

I plan to go to Salam one evening so I'll let you know what I find if I go before you. From reading up online I'm veering towards the IXUS 860 because of its wide angle lens. 8mp is more than enough for my needs so I don't think it's worth paying the extra for the 12mp 960 which doesn't have the wide angle lens (they seem to be the only differences) thatguy - Thanks. I do plan to buy online but I wanted to try out the various models before I ordered. Carrefour only have a couple of Canon compact cameras; none of them IXUS (and they appeared to have stop stocking Canon SLRs and lenses for some reason); and the Kodak shops have a very poor selection of manufacturers. -------------------------------------------- http://tall-and-ginger.blogspot.com	0

To your point; I would say it is due to the evolution of the political scene and the behaviour of the Zionist regime which pushed it into isolation to the point where they could not get adequate votes among UN member states. Additionally; west is a bit tired of supporting the Zionist's states and cleaning up its miss so they want to have some stability..The west was a key player in creating the Zionist state but they did not have the same intention Zionist's had..My thought anyway..interesting topic :)	0

Most believe in a homeland for the Palestinian people but not all can agree on what that should actually be. So making Palestine an observe state is a statement of intent without backing a full independence. Israel while continuing to build settlements in the West Bank is undermining the whole process and it seems obvious they want to swallow all Palestinian terrority. Shame on them.	0

Yes it should have been done much earlier; however what has happened has happened; and it's best to look at it from a better now than later; and better late than never angle.

This latest move is mostly symbolic; but very important and the environment of the region has changed; post Arab Spring. The global community wants a peaceful resolution and this should be two States; according to the 1967 agreement. Lets be clear; Israel is not full of Zionists (but they still seem to hold the power) and the Palestinians need to address the problem of Hamas for this to move forwards.

Q230	Q230_R57_C2	simply life what is life journy really is	Winnie Park House has currently closed its waiting list for all years. I have two children at PHES and so far have been pleased. One is in year 10 and hates the uniform; the school the teachers..... I think he is settling in nicely. We had to wait until last week (end of Sept) to get a place for my daughter in reception year. But the facilities in the primary section are good. The class rooms are bright airey clean and inviting. They have canopyed areas for the children to play outside. The school is small (about 600 including secondary); but they are currently building further extensions for sixth form. They moved into these premises over a year ago. All the teachers I have met are enthusiastic and bubbly. The head teacher Mrs Brennan is very approachable and ameniable. They have a very pragmatic approach to education and have adopted the British healthy schools policy. There is no canteen so its invent as many ways as possible to make a sandwiche look interesting for the next 10 year.....	0
Q230	Q230_R57_C3	simply life what is life journy really is	I was just this morning talking to a colleague who has two kids at Park House as I am considering sending my own daughter there. The feedback is very positive. Good facilities (they have now got their new place and are no longer using the Russian Embassy building). Apparently the teachers are very kind but also exert a strong sense of discipline and manners (cell phones are not allowed). They have recently started offering the International Baccalaureate. Everything I have heard about Park House has been very positive.	0
Q230	Q230_R57_C4	simply life what is life journy really is	Thanks very much you have really put my mind at ease.

Q230	Q230_R57_C5	simply life what is life journy really is	My husband came over by himself and he found the first week awful. He nearly came home several times. If your husband likes a drink he could try Garveys or the Rugby club. Alot of british use these. I believe you have to join as a member or come with someone as a guest.

Q230	Q230_R57_C6	simply life what is life journy really is	I have emailed you directly as I am sure there is more knowledge you can share with me. Do you live in a villa or apartment.

I suppose as I will not be working I will have to keep him occupied - any good places for children to play/met etc.. We already have a copy of Marhaba which has been useful. I think Ramadan is the biggest problem at the moment. My husband has a company vehicle but I think I will have to get a car to do the school runs etc.. do you think I could hire one initially? or lease? Who does your husband work for. My husband is working very long hours at the moment as they are so busy - keeps him out of mischief I suppose!	0

The matter of homosexuality is by far a much disputed affair among people of various religions; creeds and races; that to simply state it's right and all those who condemn it for any reason is wrong; will not be as simple. That said if they wish to protect those who are gay and transgenders from oppression and mistreatment then I suppose they have all the liberty to do so; however yes they should also then open their eyes to all the oppression committed around the world at large;and work towards stamping them out; and not just pick and choose to their convenience which has clearly been the case with UN in the recent times; which has caused people around the globe to hold them in contempt for; and not take them seriously.	0

Posts are getting so silly ; no attractive posts; ppl are divided into groups. Please leaders of QL ; try to drag QL from being another useless site. Thanks;	I agree with e46...park the car immediately. There can be several causes. If overheating; you will have a more whitish smoke mixed with steam. Do not just put water in the reservoir...you will need to use anti-freeze; but you will also need to have your thermostat checked out. If its greyish/blackish smoke; you're burning oil and you most likely have a broken head gasket or valve...both of these conditions are indicative of the worst case scenario. Also; don't forget to check your tire pressure every time you refuel.	0

In About QL they mention ""Participation is at the heart of our web site. We believe that collectively our members have more knowledge about life in Qatar than any one person or guidebook. We want to provide a platform for them to share their knowledge and experiences and help newcomers adapt easily to life in Qatar."" Nobody shares knowledge or experiences or tries to help others in a chat room; it will just become a place for guys trying to pick up girls. There will not be any participation from all the members on any issue; people will be too busy chatting in private. That's what I personally think anyway. ""Live with passion; Die with style"""	1

Thanks;	Sometimes people come into your life and you know right away that they were meant to be there.to serve some sort of purpose; teach you a lesson or help figure out who you are or who you want to become. You never know who these people may be but you lock eyes with them; you know that very moment that they will affect your life in some profound way. And sometimes things happen to you at the time that may seem horrible; painful and unfair; but in reflection you realize that without overcoming those obstacles you would never realize your potential; strength; will power or heart. Everything happens for a reason. Nothing happens by chance or by means of luck. Illness; love; lost moments of true greatness and sheer stupidity all occur to test limits of your soul. Without these small tests; life would be like a smoothly paved; straight; flat road to nowhere safe and comfortable but dull and utterly pointless. The people you meet affect your life.

Hi Cath; I'm also planning to take my car from Dubai to Doha. However; I have a couple of issues: 1. I just moved to Qatar a couple of weeks ago and haven't received my Resident Permit yet because they told me I have to cancel my Dubai visa first (even though it's my own investor visa) 2. I'm going to Dubai tomorrow to cancel my visa and then I was planning to come back in my car. Will I be able to obtain the transit visa in Saudi border if I have a Canadian passport? 3. If I get an NOC from my employer in Qatar; will that be sufficient to import my car from Dubai to Doha. 4. Will I have to pay the 5% tax if my car is 3 yrs old? Is there any way to avoid it? Thanks in advance. Noman	0

Ask your company PRO to check in the Immigration why they reject your family visa; they will sure tell him. Then you could sort out the issue before you meet the Captain.

Both KLM and Lufthanza allow you to bring pets from the UK (via Netherlands or Germany) in the cabin. The pet plus the carrier has to weigh under around 8kg (which should be fine for a small breed). Price is surprisingly minimal - it is a fixed excess baggage charge of around £70 (check with airlines). The pet has to be transported in a carrier which fits under the seat (really only during take off and touch down). There are special soft carriers which have a tent-like squashable roof which will fit under the seat and spring back up. The brand that springs to mind is Sturdibag. Good luck! Btw I was told about the airlines by Doha Vets (who were amazingly helpful) and then checked directly with the airlines in the UK; who agreed with this...	0

Thank you so much for this information Tiddsmum. Have you had experience of animals travelling this way yourself? I had checked with KLM who said exactly as you have; however when 2 companies in the U.K told me this was not allowed it left me feeling very deflated and wondering if it was maybe Doha Airport that dont accept dogs travelling this way. She is our daughters dog but is a very special part of the family and keeping our teenager onside for this move is very important. I really appreciate your replying as I have tried to obtaining this through other blogs; websites to no evail; all say cargo; excess baggage in hold. I will also contact Doha Vets who may be able to help with import certificate and help upon our arrival.	0

Get in touch with Dr Khaled El Hossan (khaled@dohavets.com); he can sort all the paperwork out this end. The import licence is valid for 1 month; but it may be worth finding out how long it takes to get one in the first place... All you will need to do is sort out the export papers from DEFRA at UK end - this is the link to the relevant contacts: http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/about/contact-us/tradeexports.html Oh; here is an example of the type of carrier: http://www.zooplus.co.uk/ask?q=sturdi+bag&num=20&form=search&gclid=CMbG7c2d468CFQt66wodhz7NwA This is all theory - I had been planning to bring out my elderly cat (who would have been too stressed in the hold); but as we are not staying in Qatar; will now not need to do this.

Oh; just double checked my facts: pet + carrier has to be under 7kg. Time to put your YT on a diet?????

Yorkies average in at 2-3 kg; my cat is 4 kg and these carriers are designed to be super light; for this exact purpose! Bar chiuauas; I cannot think of a lighter dog.

Of these your best bet for Fri and Sat night (my OPINION; so no flames from anyone) is going to be Rydges. The bar is under new Aussie management with the goal of MUCH better music and faster service. This past weekend was quite busy and the music was good enough to dance to.

They both serve alcohol; have music (live/djs) but that's where the comparison ends. ""Where would you go for RnB and hiphop?"" Take a plane and go somewhere else. :-) I'd suggest Heat or Mercury Lounge in Melbourne for RnB/Hip Hop. ;-) (Bit of promotion from an ex-employee) If you still wanna come to the Middle East for clubbing; go to Beirut or Istanbul. Maybe even Cairo for that matter. Or go to Goa; India if you wanna spend Xmas at trance parties on the beaches. Or go pub hopping in Bangalore.

I thought the band was pretty good; maybe I was hypnotized by the daisy duke shorts the singers were wearing though. Everyone that had went before me summed it up as feeling like a warehouse and it's mostly due to the white walls I think. Kinda reminded me of a high school dance in the gymnasium; buncha guys standing around leering at the girls. Hopefully after the Asian Games they will take everyone's advice and at least paint the walls and dim the lights to iimprove the atmosphere of the place. The ratio of guys to girls was about the same as everywhere else; 10 guys to 1 girl.	0

Night life in Qatar hmmmm is there such a thing? From what I can tell they are full of Philipino women and old western men with a few other undesirables in. Doha amongst many other cities in the world have a lot to learn about night clubs; what makes them good and what makes them bad. Predominantly what makes them bad are the clients that frequent them; in the case of Doha they will always be bad. Face facts if you got to a nightclub to pick up women (of any culture) then your not in to clubbing!	0

Many clubs are just institutions to carry on drinking after normal club closing time and to pick up members of the opposite sex. Real clubbing....IS.... music; dancing not what has been described on here. This is not just my opinion; there are many clubbing web pages; and you will find it hard pressed to find a description of what is described on this forum. Have you ever been to Ibiza? granted the drug scene is far to prevalent there but it is all about fun music and dancing; not about picking up women!	0

I suffer from lackness of cultural events in Doha. As I missed Anatolian Fire; Madame Butterfly under Asian Games events; I would like to see such entertaining performances more in Doha. Much more that if we can not find any place for one ; we can go for the other:D For example; there are some nice places making wonderful fruit cocktails; why not play bowling while you drink? A big complex with bowling; billiard; electronic games for adults strongly required... About Alaaddin's Kingdom;it is the only theme park with nothing! It should be more inviting...with some little theatre shows; animal shows; high quality electronic video games; good food; some recreation near sea...

As someone who just came back from UAE last week; doha is not even close to what abu dhabi is right now. No contest. AD has much much much more social/night life; infrastructure is generations ahead; the roads in abu dhabi are second to none; traffic is well taken care of and life in general is much better. Women are way way way nicer and much more social as well. Build quality of the houses is far ahead of what is available in doha and the city is much cleaner; greener and about a million times better organized. As for roads; ill put it this way; i was at the officers club in Abu Dhabi late for my flight. So I told my taxi driver (mercedes e class wagon) to plz hurry to the airport. He was driving at 200-220kph only slowing down to 140kph for the cameras; and drove at that speed for a good 10 mins; and had me at my destination well before time. Roads in Abu dhabi are AMAZING.

Q234	Q234_R3_C8	Immigration to Canada Hi: i am going to apply for immigration to canada ; i want know is canada a peaceful country like qatar ? thnaks;	As some of you have suggested; to apply for permanent residency in Canada is pretty straight forward o majority of the cases.  The Green Card is only referring to permanent resident of the States; not Canada.  Also; the color of the card for permanent resident card has been changed to white color many yaers ago though most people still refer to green card. To qualify for Canadian permanent resident visa; you  need to accumulate a total of 67 points (used to be 75 points) which are based on your age; education level; profession; employment status; english proficiency; suitability; and among others.  Just go to the official canadian immigration website as stated above and u will get all the info.  God luck~!	1

Q234	Q234_R5_C3	Immigration to Canada Hi: i am going to apply for immigration to canada ; i want know is canada a peaceful country like qatar ? thnaks;	doesn't matter what you are going through! Canada Immigration officer doesn't care about it. He/She is strictly following the procedure; rules and instructions. and by the way this is the first thing you guys have to learn about canada. You have to be loyal and law obedient and rules respectful. No fooling around; no playing games; no middle-eastern tricks and focus-pocuses! If you have gained enough points on six factors; you become eligible to APPLY for the Immigration. It doesn’t make you a Permanent Resident automatically though. ********************* “You become responsible forever for what you have tamed”. Antoine de Saint-Exupéry	0

Sometimes everything goes smooth and easy. Sometimes there are hidden problems on the way. Filling up the application is a very first and easiest step of the process. On the other hand; if the information provided in the application form is correct and TRUTHFUL; and based on this information the person is eligible for the immigration process; it shouldn’t be any issue with that.. but sometimes some unpredictable things happen.. here is the example. 5 points are given for the relatives in Canada. Let’s say the applicant has a sister who possesses a Resident status in Canada. While filling in the application; the applicant adds 5 points to his score; and it helps him to get 67 points. But.. once the Immigration Office asks for the documents to prove the claims in the initial application. And then it turns out; that a sister doesn’t live in Canada at all.

Thats down to morals and common sense. A lawyer or consultant is not all that helpful. If you have questions about the application you can usually find it on the site. If any questions arise the embassy will call you. Also dont believe them when they say their clients never get interviews; these are also random and if you are on the up and up no worries. A lawyer/consultant will cost you between 2000-3000 $. Totally not worth it; Just make sure you have all the required docs etc together and understand the process from the site before applying.

Q234	Q234_R9_C7	Immigration to Canada Hi: i am going to apply for immigration to canada ; i want know is canada a peaceful country like qatar ? thnaks;	Every country is getting strict on their immigration... Recently Australia has announced some insane changes in their immigration policies.... Every country requires that one should live in its country but people use to live anywhere else after getting immigration. Now they realized and changed their policies and forcing immigrants to live in the country otherwise they will not renew the residency... But I was thinking if they do not increase their birth rate and skill sets; they have to soften their policies for immigrants :)	0

Q234	Q234_R9_C9	Immigration to Canada Hi: i am going to apply for immigration to canada ; i want know is canada a peaceful country like qatar ? thnaks;	Very much depend on your reason for migrating. Is it economic opportunity; education; life styles and anything else not the least; which country will accept you. As general rule; for economic migrants (I assume you are; apology if wrong) from Ghana (Your profile); both are good. Never live in Canada so I can not comment but for Australia as someone else mention; there are a bit of resistance from earlier migrant (after all Australian aside from the indigeous people are migrants or convicts at some stage of history) about allowing more to come. Basically it affect mid level skilled person/tradesman such as cooks; hairdresser; carpenter; electricians etc. For higher qualifications (engineers; doctors); I believe the door is still open. Cheers SK BTW; if you decide to go to Australia; you DO NOT need to enggage the service of a migration agent. They mostly act as an administrative assistant (ie. reminding you of which document to submit etc) and have no impact on your selectibility.	0

I think you are trying to do that but you cannot because you do not represent Canada people in this forum. Actually I know some good people from Canada and they told me more about Canada. But I just asked this question to hear from foreigners who lived in Canada before or still living there. This is because foreigners experience in a country cannot be the same as that of citizens. I am wondering why you think I want to immigrate to Canada….. Or go there for passport …where didn’t I mention that? It is very funny hahaa Does my question about immigration mean that I want to immigrate to Canada? Why don’t you that it could be research purpose or any other thing else?

Lots of Tax system which is the biggest killer...so take your decision based on the fact that u either have lots of money or you dont make any money when u go there..lol..simple..	0
Q234	Q234_R41_C9	Immigration to Canada Hi: i am going to apply for immigration to canada ; i want know is canada a peaceful country like qatar ? thnaks;	Family friends of ours(the whole family) migrated to Canda about 10 years back. The parents thought it was extremly cold(they were basically from south india which is more or less tropical). The kids did their college education there and love it there but the family is back in India although the kids are canadian citizens now and want to return. The dad was working in Qatar Petroleum for at least 15 years before they migrated so they must've saved a lot of money before they went. Upto you dude. I donno abt australian though.	1

""He knew about the initial 3 years struggle.""; but ""He came back to India after 4 mths"" and ""he returned after 2 months again""... what a nonsense... ...and how do you think hundreds of thousand of immigrants make it??? if all of them went ""back to India after 4 months""; no immigrants would live in T.O. by now...lol... ...and for the doctors and lawyers everywhere are the same rules: you have to start your study all over again; or at least to do a very very very difficult exam before your practicing.. which is absolutely right!! Norms and standards are different in different parts of the world; please understand it... it people's health and lives in their hands. Every normal government wants to make sure it has done according to its rules and regulations. ...and how many people cannot find a job here in Qatar either??? ...and if YOU know ""someone"" who couldn't succeed; it doesn't mean other thousands and thousands of immigrants cannot succeed either... and.. ....."	0

Q234	Q234_R45_C4	Immigration to Canada Hi: i am going to apply for immigration to canada ; i want know is canada a peaceful country like qatar ? thnaks;	You don't just pay for a visa of any kind (except perhaps a visit visa) to Canada - AND you deal with government offices and agencies; not recruiters if you want to be sure you're not being overcharged or cheated.	1

Q234	Q234_R45_C6	Immigration to Canada Hi: i am going to apply for immigration to canada ; i want know is canada a peaceful country like qatar ? thnaks;	I would strongly suggest you skip the recruiter. You can fill in all the documents on your own - look for the Canadian embassy in Kuwait in Google and you will find all that you need there. Unless you have lots of money; skills that are in demand (and papers to prove your qualifications); or are a refugee; it is very difficult to get in to Canada. It can take years for the papers to get through so if someone has told you 10 months; that is probably completely unrealistic.	1

Q234	Q234_R50_C1	Immigration to Canada Hi: i am going to apply for immigration to canada ; i want know is canada a peaceful country like qatar ? thnaks;	"There is no such thing as birth tourism in Canada. In fact; you will probably either be denied a visa or turned away at immigration if there is any suspicion that you are there solely to give birth. This is an immigration ""scam"" because Canada confers nationality on children born in Canada - but reserves the right to deport the parents. Be very careful. There have been cases where the baby gets to stay; but the parents have to leave."	0

Q234	Q234_R50_C3	Immigration to Canada Hi: i am going to apply for immigration to canada ; i want know is canada a peaceful country like qatar ? thnaks;	"Another issue; how about the hospital costs. Just to ""sit"" in a hospital bed as a non-Canadian costs about CAD1500/day (on a ward with 9 other people - not being seen by a doctor; no food; no medicine; no treatment). That's nearly 5000QAR/day before treatment. Can you afford this?"	0
Q234	Q234_R50_C4	Immigration to Canada Hi: i am going to apply for immigration to canada ; i want know is canada a peaceful country like qatar ? thnaks;	do such thing exist?	0
Q234	Q234_R50_C5	Immigration to Canada Hi: i am going to apply for immigration to canada ; i want know is canada a peaceful country like qatar ? thnaks;	Yes it DOES exist and it still is legal to have your baby both in the States and Canada as a visitor.Anyone who is born in USA and Canada is automatically deemed to be citizen regardless of the parent's status or residency or citizenship. There are such agencies back home in Hong Kong; Singapore and Seoul. Just type it on google I am sure you'll find a few...Young Asian couples are really into this idea. In fact; my younger sister did it in Canada about a year ago. So my niece has become Canadian by birth and has gotten a Canadian passport. Neither my brother-in-law nor my sister were Canadian resident or citizen at the time of birth. The OB-GYN; the housing and the hospital all cost them around 30.000USD. They did it in Toronto and stayed in a furnished home for three months. My sis said everything went good and that they never were treated badly just because they happen to have a baby there as non-residents. So I think it's for sure worth doing if you want the US or Canadian citizens.....	0
Q234	Q234_R50_C6	Immigration to Canada Hi: i am going to apply for immigration to canada ; i want know is canada a peaceful country like qatar ? thnaks;	It is NOT legal to operate as a birth tourism company to have a child in Canada. Canada confers citizenship automatically on babies born there NOT on their parents who CAN and ARE deported; thereby separating families. THIS IS A SCAM to try and gain access to Canadian citizenship by circumventing the immigration rules and regulations by having a baby in Canada. Immigration in Canada is well aware of this and do take steps to circumvent it. Again; I ask; why don't you want YOUR child to have YOUR nationality?	0
Q234	Q234_R50_C7	Immigration to Canada Hi: i am going to apply for immigration to canada ; i want know is canada a peaceful country like qatar ? thnaks;	We just want the citizenship for our baby. We think we can offer the costs that come with this. BTW; I am well aware of the fact that only my baby gets the citizenship by birth NOT us;the parents. So In this case; there is no scam that I get dragged into.	0
Q234	Q234_R50_C8	Immigration to Canada Hi: i am going to apply for immigration to canada ; i want know is canada a peaceful country like qatar ? thnaks;	I would be very careful; Canada Immigration does not look kindly on those who try to get citizenship for their children in this way.

Winnie Park House has currently closed its waiting list for all years. I have two children at PHES and so far have been pleased. One is in year 10 and hates the uniform; the school the teachers..... I think he is settling in nicely. We had to wait until last week (end of Sept) to get a place for my daughter in reception year. But the facilities in the primary section are good. The class rooms are bright airey clean and inviting. They have canopyed areas for the children to play outside. The school is small (about 600 including secondary); but they are currently building further extensions for sixth form. They moved into these premises over a year ago. All the teachers I have met are enthusiastic and bubbly. The head teacher Mrs Brennan is very approachable and ameniable. They have a very pragmatic approach to education and have adopted the British healthy schools policy. There is no canteen so its invent as many ways as possible to make a sandwiche look interesting for the next 10 year.....	0

I was just this morning talking to a colleague who has two kids at Park House as I am considering sending my own daughter there. The feedback is very positive. Good facilities (they have now got their new place and are no longer using the Russian Embassy building). Apparently the teachers are very kind but also exert a strong sense of discipline and manners (cell phones are not allowed). They have recently started offering the International Baccalaureate. Everything I have heard about Park House has been very positive.	0

My husband came over by himself and he found the first week awful. He nearly came home several times. If your husband likes a drink he could try Garveys or the Rugby club. Alot of british use these.

I have emailed you directly as I am sure there is more knowledge you can share with me. Do you live in a villa or apartment. Our company has provided us with a new 3 bed apartment and I do not know what it will be like with a 7yr old; he is used to playing out on his bike etc... I suppose as I will not be working I will have to keep him occupied - any good places for children to play/met etc.. We already have a copy of Marhaba which has been useful. I think Ramadan is the biggest problem at the moment. My husband has a company vehicle but I think I will have to get a car to do the school runs etc.. do you think I could hire one initially? or lease? Who does your husband work for. My husband is working very long hours at the moment as they are so busy - keeps him out of mischief I suppose!	0

Fact : If your company terminates you; take that letter to your bank ; you won't be required to pay any remaining amount ; bank will use its tacts ; don't yield ; after few days of delay ; finally you will get clearance from bank and fly home .. Insurer of your money / bank would pay that amount to bank; may be insurer and bank are having offices in the same building / or managers are cousins / they are after your money / so escape clear from both parties / Pray hard / Good luck in finding another job soon somewhere / Regards.	0

They don't have to do simple things like tests to get a liscense; they are given the keys to massive SUV's with little or no experience acutally driving a vehicle; they have little or no respect for traffic laws or anyone else on the road; they have speed issues in that anything under 120 kms an hour is two slow.

How long have you been in Qatar? I do not think you have been here longâ€¦. If you are new and you drive; then wait and see a few Land Cruisers cut you off; make your heart come to your mouth with their speed limit breaking speeds and piss you off by flashing their lights behind you in the fast lane and honking at you at roundabouts like they got shit in their pants. I have been here for 15 years and I have not seen anything change with regards to the way Qatariâ€™s drive. Like MunozC Mentioned itâ€™s a downright attitude problem... They just think; I can drive in my country the way I like and get away with it; you drive and be careful and weep when you try to mess with me. I have friends who have had skirmishes with these guys at times and they have insulted them and even gone to the extent of try to hit them when they have been proved wrong; right in front of the cops.

The flashing lights thing really irks my nerves. I stay in the lane when they do it. If someone drives up behind me and they don't flash their lights or get right on the back of my car; I move. I have respect for the patient people here. I'm a fast driver but these people are nuts. I drive fast when I know I have a clearing. I have seen people speed through compounds. I find it nice that when you're on a 2 lane road and there is a bit of a wait at the r/a; people make 4 lanes. Crazy.	0

It would be good if the Police (or traffic Police)first follow proper driving techniques/rules. ie: 1) hands free phone or preferable park and then speak on the phone. 2) follow speed limit. 3) not drive over footpath in private cruiser with uniform on. 4) immediate fine to anyone driving while holding the phone; or child on drivers lap; or driver with foot on the dashboard; or without seatbelt. 5) point system should be started in Qatar as most of the people breaking the law have the necessary funds. The list can go on. These are the ones I think need immediate attention. the first three points apply to the Police.	0

In fairness it's not just the Qatari's that are poor drivers; but alot of expats as well. Allowing your children to roam around in a moving vehicle is not only dangerous; but stupid. Road accidents cause 62 deaths in seven months DOHA â€¢ The death toll in road accidents in the country was higher at 62 between January and July this year and a total of 107 people were left critically injured; a local Arabic daily reported yesterday citing figures from the Department of Traffic and Patrol Police. A majority of the deaths (36) occurred in the satellite township of Al Rayyan; followed by Madinat Khalifa (18) and Old Airport Area in Doha (05). At least 700 cases of road accidents were referred to the courts over the seven-month period. A total of 6;654 accidents took place during the period; while minor accidents totallled an incredible 26;697. PLEASE; wear seat-belts; buckle-up your children and drive safely!!!	0

The Westbay CC area is pretty small; so you should be able to drive yourself around and visit each building. (maybe a dozen buildings) I think they all have onsite management that can show you what is available. Personally; I think the Pearl and Falcon Towers adjacent to the 4 Seasons Hotel are the best units and best located especially if you are able to join the Four Seasons Spa / Health Club. Al Farden Tower (where the BMW dealer is located) is very nice; but no balconies if that is important to you. 44 Westbay Tower also has very nice units and great views from the upper floors. The residences at the W Hotel are also quite nice; but no balconies.	0

Hi there; I used to have a Cat before and sell it in one shop in Nasser street that is opposite to Falcon Entertainment Co. on the corner for 600 Q.R. It was a Persian one and this is the photo: I got again from this shop [sorry; forget the name] also a fish tank that costs me with the cleaning machine+3 fishes+Colored stones+small ship to put in the bottom 360. The tank is quiet big and it is so cool. Looking for the food; go to Carrefour [City Center & Villagio]; Giant Stores; don't go to the supermarkets because the stock there is kept for a while. The first time you got the food from the shop would be better to know which food is good for your pet; after that look in the mentioned above markets because it would be mostly cheaper. with Regards	0

Q236	Q236_R5_C4	Pet Shop Hi! Would someone know any nearby pet shop to get fishes (e.g. Goldfishes and the like)? I am at Bin Mahmoud.	Alyson; you can get Royal Canin for cats here; I always buy the hairball control at Doha Vets. If they don't have the specific for persians; they'll probably order it for you. I think their website is www.dohavets.com or something like that. If I may suggest; if you use an enclosed litter box; bring one with you; as they are very expensive here (QR250 for a really cheap looking one). Also bring toys; they are not easy to find here. And stuff like nail clipper as well. Oh; and frontline is also quite expensive here; and I haven't found the specific one for cats; the vet told me to simply put less of the dog one. Anyway; those are the things you should know if you're bringing kittie with you.	1

Q236	Q236_R46_C7	Pet Shop Hi! Would someone know any nearby pet shop to get fishes (e.g. Goldfishes and the like)? I am at Bin Mahmoud.	Right tallg; but those poor animals being in the pet shops have a very bad life there; I really feel sorry for them. The best would be to have pet shops with normal conditions for animals; why can' they do it here? It's true that had working hadn't killed anyone yet; but why to take risk?	0

These creatures can live for many decades and could conceivably outlive you! So if you want to take on this really big commitment you may want to look for a very healthy bird; not one from a pet shop as tallg and MD recommend. Price should not be the major criteria in a long-term; committed care-taking relationship with a beloved pet. Mandi	0

Q236	Q236_R46_C10	Pet Shop Hi! Would someone know any nearby pet shop to get fishes (e.g. Goldfishes and the like)?

Q237	Q237_R23_C1	half-sisters can my half-sister apply a family visit visa for me?	It is a very rare Qatari man that would want anything more than what you just described. It is a very rare man in Qatar that wants anything more to do with a Western girl than you just described. Meeting men here is like stepping through a minefield. 9 out of 10 of them just want sex. And they will do and say anything to get it from you. I am not bitter; I do not hate men; but I have been living in various parts of Asia for the last 2 and a half years. Trust me when I say if you do not want to get burned be VERY careful who you date. Asian opinion of Western women is not very high when it comes to sex and dating.

Q237	Q237_R23_C3	half-sisters can my half-sister apply a family visit visa for me?	I must tell you redcajun504 Arab youths can go to any extent to get sex; but so is men from any country. Men have always sex on mind. It is always advisable to be cautious. But why are you worrying? There is a huge expat population here; which includes Indians; Europeans; Americans and even Australians. So; it's not a problem basically. Ask Sunny to be prudent and approach the things casually; without any pre-conceived notions; though caution is utmost required. You never know you may actually get a gem of person among these Arabians. After all; many of them have married Westerners. But dohagirl as such is correct that youths here always look for sex. On my own experience I must tell you they see Russians; Lebanese and Filipinos as someone always available for sex. Actually; this part of the world has many prostitutes from these communities; thronging star hotels. Use your common sense and things will be cozier for you. I wish you and your sister best of luck.

Q237	Q237_R23_C4	half-sisters can my half-sister apply a family visit visa for me?	Life is not easy if you are a Western Woman; and the main reason a man from this part of the world would want a western woman is mainly for sex. However; please do not for one moment think that the men and women here con't have premarital relationships - they do it just not talked about and it is not caried out in the open. Due to the conservative background of the boys they will always return to their families and it would be vry difficult for them to marry outside the families would not be happy about it. I think it is much better to be very cautious out here although there are a great many handsome men and they can be very charming going through the Arab and Asian world of men they are all interested in SEX. One of the things is that being found to be together whoc ae not married can get into very deep trouble here - just a little food for thought.	0
Q237	Q237_R23_C5	half-sisters can my half-sister apply a family visit visa for me?	Sadly this has been the case for many years. Maybe it originally stems from the days when arabs had loads of money; visited capital cities (mainly in the West) and were naturally surrounded (as they were rich) by hookers. Word spread when they returned that they had been with western women. The assumption would then be made that all Western women were loose. That is the assumption that we came to many years ago.

It is a very rare Western man that would want anything more than what you just described. It is a very rare man in the West that wants anything more to do with a Asian girl than you just described. Its impossible to believe that the thousands of crippled shaking 70 year old Western men moving with 21 year old Asian beauties do so...because the guy was so romantic; loving and responsible that the girl fell head over heals in love with him..

At least they are rich and handsome; and donÂ´t get completely drunkenly smashed in public; so donÂ´t worry about dating them. Thing is; if you behave like a slut;all men will treat you like a slut.

Q237	Q237_R30_C5	half-sisters can my half-sister apply a family visit visa for me?	Body sugaring is a method for removing body hair that is a cheap; homemade alternative to waxing (or shaving). The theory behind body sugaring is that the hair is removed by the root; and when it grows back there will be less of it; and it will be softer and not stubbly as it is if a razor had been used. Body sugaring is done by making a paste of sugar; water; and lemon juice that has been heated to the softball candy stage. http://www.care2.com/greenliving/ancient-egyptian-body-sugaring.html# Sounds painful already......	0

Later on there's a buffet and an ""'ardha"" which is a traditional sword dance. Very nice; beautifully decorated garments. After that groom goes to the women's party and joins the bride.

Q237	Q237_R38_C7	half-sisters can my half-sister apply a family visit visa for me?	Don't hate me diamondgirl....this certainly does not apply to everyone....but my personal experience here in doha is that MOST do not speak english. Even people who are not local and come from the subcontinent and claim to speak english do not understand you or prove able to articulate their thoughts in english. I'm not trying to upset anyone; but i'm calling it like I see it. This is a true story: I called the information number provided on the Qatar Foundation website to get some information on the American universities you hear so much hype about; and was shunted through 4 different people who could not speak english! This isn't an obscure gvt office in the ministry of islamic studies or whatever....this was QATAR Foundation!! SO: No! English is not a main language in Qatar...and is mostly spoken by the European and North American Expat communities only. Stay safe all. Perfection does not exist.

Good Morning; Unfortunately; this is a melting pot for different languages Tagalog; Hindi; Urdu; Arabic and English please forgive any languages I forgot.

Wen I go to a shope and there is and Indian salesman I have to aske at least three times what he is saying ans this is meant seriously; there are other whose English is wonderful. Most people in Government positions are well versed in English although I have to admit we there are a nuber of employees who speak very little English. You seem to have encountered the very few that don't speak english. May I add this comment here; many more Arabs speak English than English speaking races speak Arabic.	0

Q237	Q237_R58_C5	half-sisters can my half-sister apply a family visit visa for me?	It could very well be true. Qatarization is a very high priority here. But with that said; saying that Qataris should fill secretarial positions and getting them to do so are two different things. A national is going to have to want the job before the job is Qatarized. I'm not sure how this would be handled so I don't see it happening overnight. I'm not sure if this refers to replacing people already in positions or for new positions opening up. One would like to think that expats will keep their job until their contract runs out at least. Also - it could be that a qualified Qatari is given first opportunity at a new position and if it isn't filled then it can be opened up to expats. In any event - it will take time to sort out.	0
Q237	Q237_R58_C6	half-sisters can my half-sister apply a family visit visa for me?	"I can see it happening overnight indeed.

What silliness; we can't hire anyone to fill the positions as they are reserved for Qataris; but we can't find any Qataris willing to take the jobs; and nothing is getting done. Why are administrative positions considered to be ""unskilled"" anyway? A good admin assistant is worth their weight in gold."	0

Q237	Q237_R58_C9	half-sisters can my half-sister apply a family visit visa for me?	"the ""pecking"" order for jobs has always been Qatari first; second was other arab and third was any other nationality. Admin jobs (particularly HR) have always been seen as an easy Qatarisation option. It's not like an operational job where; if somebody screws up; there's often a big bang or an accident. HR and its systems can slowly deteriorate with no apparent effect......until the system does collapse and by then it's often too late. Enter the expats again to sort things out. One comment. If the jobs have been vacant for so long; do you actually need the jobs?"	0

Q237	Q237_R59_C7	half-sisters can my half-sister apply a family visit visa for me?	without government approval of your marriage; you won't get a family visa back into Qatar; unfortunately. Marrying you out of the country can cause major problems for your fiance; so I would suggest you wait until your marriage is approved. The only other option is that you relocate somewhere else; marry there; but your marriage will not be valid in Qatar; and you will have no claim to any inheritences if god forbid; something should happen to him. Does your fiance not have some Wasta; that can obtain your release from your company? I am not saying that will make things any easier; since you still need to have the govt approval for marriage; but at least you can be in Qatar; near him.	1

Q237	Q237_R65_C5	half-sisters can my half-sister apply a family visit visa for me?	Would openly list countries where homosexuality is outlawed to be a vagabond nations. The matter of homosexuality is by far a much disputed affair among people of various religions; creeds and races; that to simply state it's right and all those who condemn it for any reason is wrong; will not be as simple. That said if they wish to protect those who are gay and transgenders from oppression and mistreatment then I suppose they have all the liberty to do so; however yes they should also then open their eyes to all the oppression committed around the world at large;and work towards stamping them out; and not just pick and choose to their convenience which has clearly been the case with UN in the recent times; which has caused people around the globe to hold them in contempt for; and not take them seriously.	0

I came back from Europe last week with 2+ kilos in my checked bag - as did at least a dozen others on the same flight. Alcohol will be confiscated; no doubt about it; but the pork seems to be winked at as it goes through the scanner. I've never heard of anyone being detained or arrested for bringing either into the country - the alcohol was simply confiscated and they were warned not to try and bring it again. Nationality and ethnicity may play a role here. I'm a white Western middleaged female. Asian and other people of colour may have a different experience and perhaps someone can speak to that point. Many Westerners here travel to UAE or Bahrain and bring back pork with no incident (in my 2+ years here).	1

Here is a zero tolerance policy towards drugs and penalties for drug trafficking include the death penalty or life in jail. Penalties for possession or use of illegal drugs include imprisonment and heavy fines. Qatar has issued a warning to visitors to be aware of its strict laws against illegal drug possession. The presence of illegal drugs detected in blood or urine tests is considered possession. You may also be charged with possessing drugs if trace amounts are found on your body; clothing or luggage. Amounts of 0.05 grams or less can lead to guilty verdicts. Medication available over the counter or by prescription in your country may be illegal or considered a controlled substance in the Qatar. .	0

Q239	Q239_R13_C10	Liquor Permit Can anyone tell me what is the minimum salary required to apply for Liquor Permit and other formalities? Thanks	I just applied for a permit last night with my husband; who is here under my sponsorship. We were issued a joint permit; with a shared limit based on my salary; but we each received our own card. My husband just arrived and is not yet employed. If you are not employed; and if your father were willing to apply with you; perhaps you could get a joint family permit. I have had to write a no objection letter in order for my husband to apply for a driver's license since he is here under my sponsorship; so perhaps your father could do the same for the liquor permit if you are employed and want your own permit. If your father doesn't want you to have a permit; I think you are out of luck. :-) As a side note; my permit was issued with a limit at well under the 10% of monthly salary I have read about. Mine was issued at about 5% of my monthly salary.	0

Any one who compares the two cities proves hes hasnt been to one of them. As someone who just came back from UAE last week; doha is not even close to what abu dhabi is right now. No contest. AD has much much much more social/night life; infrastructure is generations ahead; the roads in abu dhabi are second to none; traffic is well taken care of and life in general is much better. Women are way way way nicer and much more social as well. Build quality of the houses is far ahead of what is available in doha and the city is much cleaner; greener and about a million times better organized. As for roads; ill put it this way; i was at the officers club in Abu Dhabi late for my flight. So I told my taxi driver (mercedes e class wagon) to plz hurry to the airport. He was driving at 200-220kph only slowing down to 140kph for the cameras; and drove at that speed for a good 10 mins; and had me at my destination well before time. Roads in Abu dhabi are AMAZING.

I don't have a curfew..I think that might depend upon what job you have and the requirements. Active night life..there is one but its limited. I see you are from the UK..will be honest with you and say its nothing like the pub scene back there. Clubs and pubs are located ONLY in hotels. Easy to get around if you drive..but you have to be aggressive in your driving manner and defensive...;) I just like it here; for many many reasons...but you DO need to look at all the perspectives before coming here. ONE main one is that the riyal is pegged to the dollar..NOT the English Pound...	1

As you told it is your 2nd sponsor; it mean you transfor your old visa to the new sponsor; so i think he dont have any problem to give you release bcoz he did'nt buy your visa; he hired you localy; but even though everything is in his hand; most of the companies are not giving release; bcoz they bought visas and if they release it mean they are giving visa; but in your case you just transfor your visa to the new company; so i think if you request him when he is in good mood; i hope he'll deal you good; InshaAllah BEST OF LUCK	0

Thank you in advance.........	Alphy; since her Work visa was rejected; what make you thinking that switching any other type of visa to Work visa will be easier? You misunderstand the process. MOL doesn't know where the perosn is. They don't even care whether the person is here in qatar or back home. They either ISSUE a work visa or they do not! Once the Work visa is approved and issued; then either the person is coming to Qatar (if he/she is outside of qatar) or switches his/her present visa status (tourist/family/business) to Work visa. But the Work visa must be approved and issued in any case regardless to where the person is. So it absolutely doesn't matter where she is. You will only waste your money and time bringing her on tourist visa and getting rejection of her work visa again.

And I have got a meeting date 23 Feb to know the reason of rejection. Can I apply my wife visit visa now. or should I wait until to finalize the labor Dept process. Please suggest.. Thank you in advance.........	The answer is NO. There's no such thing as NOC from hotel visa ok? hotel visa is valid only; based on your stay in the hotel in Qatar. That's it. If you want her to come here in Doha; it is either you sponsor her(from your company); or complete her CV and submit it to companies which has vacancies. Some companies(ones they accepted the application of the employee) shoulder the visa from the country of origin; ticket to Doha; etc. That's what I did. I'm not sure why your company rejected her application. Maybe you should try other companies. Goodluck! Ciao.	0

Here are a few (not tried and tested) but you can always get adventorous : 1. Ask personal questions to the most snobish salesman at a snobish outlet. 2. Talk in a higly accented english with the same snobish salesman (rehearse beforehand- another way to kill time). 3. Give a fake smile to people at corniche. Make it snappy like a flash. 4. Make funny/scary faces at kids on corniche. 5. Make a list of all swear words you know and keep the list ready for use (in purse/besides phone/in your car). 6. If you are working than prepare a list of important phone numbers in the smallest font possible and stick it on your computer monitor with a bright sticker. Think and analyse the reaction of your work mates on weekends. Bye and cheers.	0

It's not what you do; or what there is to do; it's who you do it with! A weekend alone is not good; you need to meet someone or some friends to spend time with; then the weekend will be too short. Although there is much to do in Doha; it is boring doing it alone. Take up a new sport or hobby that involves meeting people. I started playing golf and met loads of people.

Thanks; how awesome; I was thinking it was more like 1.5 hours from what everyone has said about Doha traffic!! :) Being here in the USA is a bit difficult to find out what areas are best to live in Doha... My husband and I love being at home; we prefer high rises with a nice gym though given we are bringing motorcycles over I am thinking somthingh is a garage might be best. We have no kids so schools and having other kids around us is not a top priority. Given this; which areas/buildings would you guys recommend? We don't want to commute more than say 30-40 minutes each way if we can help it (to and from new DOHA airport). What information is there out there about the Pearl; I imagine is still is mostly a huge construction site but are there finished buildigns there worth commuting to and from? Are shoping areas and restaurants nearby already finished? Thanks so much! Kiki	0

"Qatar's property development websites are misleading as most of Qatar itself. What you see is not what you'll get. Lusail is a ""planned new city"" due to open soon but you go there now; all you'll se is an empty desert land with maybe 2 tower cranes. Pearl is nearly completed but with a lot of infrastructure and other nature problems. Both locations are at the north outskirts limits of the city; while the new airport is being built at the southern outskirt limit of the city. You do have to across the whole city and the traffic here is another nightmare (not only the traffic jams but also the aggressive and risk driving local style). If no traffic; it will be a 20-30 minutes drive. The best location for you would be near by the Marriott Hotel. A friendly advice: be prepared for the biggest frustrations you ever experienced at professional and social levels and you won't be disappointed. I wish you all the best!"	0

"Yes I'm from Florida and yes photography pays *some* of our bills ;) Husband got contract to work in Doha so I am thinking the expensive part of living arrangements there will all depend on what his contract stipulates. Thanks for the real estate agent contact mdobrasz; will see if we can start lining up some visits to different areas and take a look at villas vs condo... not sure what is best for us yet. I think given we are going to try to bring our 2 motorcycles a house with a garage will be best... Nic; thanks for the advice; I think we'll probably opt to be closet to airport than to drive 1 hour to get to and from work.

Hi; I am not actually in Doha yet myself; arriving at the end of this month. The only vehcile imports I have done in Doha previously was for the Oilfield Market; and is done slightly differently. You might be surprised; I seen a couple of big bike shops here in Doha when I visted a few weeks back. Anyhow; in Dubai a few years ago; I imported some choppers from the guys off Discovery Channel program. The Duty was 5% of the CIF Value. (eg. Bike is US $20000 CIF then Duty will be US $1000) I then had to pay a local agent commission on the import of US $1500 each as they held the import licence agreements for the bikes. Therafter; Police Inspection; Registration and other details were approx. $1200 per bike. Then of course you will have standard insurance and road tax; which I believe is approx. $100 per month in Doha. (Someone can correct me if I am wrong) PM me if you need further information; I do work in this field and can get a colleague to check all the ins and outs if required. Have.....	0

Check out some you-tube videos showing all the spectacular car crashes in Doha. You have to see it to believe it. Seriously most people see a car crash every single day. Riding motorcycles on the streets in Doha is only for fools in my opinion.	0

I see you are from the UK..will be honest with you and say its nothing like the pub scene back there. Clubs and pubs are located ONLY in hotels. Easy to get around if you drive..but you have to be aggressive in your driving manner and defensive...;) I just like it here; for many many reasons...but you DO need to look at all the perspectives before coming here.

Here are some pointers - Speak English at home; ban any other language - Always try to use subtitles when watching TV/DVD - Only listen to English Music - Only read English books; papers etc etc Youngsters absorb language fairly quick and in my humble opinion do not need tutoring; as they will get English in school either way.	0

Q244	Q244_R15_C7	Bake bread at home I do Who else bakes bread at home?	As promised on my previous post; I'm very glad to inform you that gluten free bread can be ordered at the bakery corner of La Cigale Hotel. The pastry chef prepares white bread; pesto bread; tomato bread and thyme bread. He can also bake small sandwiches. He also offers delicious cookies. You will have to place your order one or two days in advance as this is a special preparation requesting a place and baking instruments completely free of gluten. We eat these breads since a few week and are very satisfied. Bon appetit	0

Q244	Q244_R15_C10	Bake bread at home I do Who else bakes bread at home?	You can probably order your GF bread from La Cigale by phone but I think that; the 1st time; it is better to go to the bakery counter or to the casher. Try to get a phone contact or an email for the next orders. Sorry but I may not give you the contacts I got there... The price for a 1/2 kg bread is 50 QAR. It is not cheap but compared to the bread sold in Megamarkt; it is cheap AND better. You can contact me through this email adress : gf.jodemaere@spamgourmet.com !!! this address is a disposable address and will not work anymore after a short while.	0

Wheat bran I saw at Megamart just this morning with the other grains....3rd aisle from the left of the store; back section(I believe!) Postmodernman...baking soda is now readily available at Megamart and Shoprite on a regular basis. If you have problems; look for Bicarbonate of Soda..same thing.

Q244	Q244_R29_C4	Bake bread at home I do Who else bakes bread at home?	I have started cooking from scratch which is probably healthier but its time consuming with three different diets. In the UK you can buy wheat free; milk free and lactose free products. I did find wheat free flour sporadically from Megamart and Soya milk isn't too hard to find but most of it tastes bad.	0
Q244	Q244_R29_C5	Bake bread at home I do Who else bakes bread at home?	I am suppose to be wheat intolerant but in this country I have given up and am bloated all the time. Mega mart also has wheat free flour to make your own bread; doubles up great for pizza bases; carrefore occasionally stocks wheat free nut bread. Simple treat for you to try is 1 c peanut butter; 1 c sugar; 1 egg. Mix all together; put spoonfuls on a greased tray and bake at 180 for about 20min (golden). They may come out a little soft but will harden. Good luck!   I may be blonde but I am wise smile lots laugh more	0
Q244	Q244_R29_C6	Bake bread at home I do Who else bakes bread at home?	"Megamart does have the best selection. Edensoy milk is some of the best tasting (especially vanilla). It comes fortified in some varieties. Read labels on everything. If the product is from the US; it will list CONTAINS MILK in bold letters on the bottom of the ingredients. Some poptarts are milk free (cinnamon; strawberry; and apple flavor). Be cautious with chocolate. Milk is in all Cadbury chocolate. Some dark brands are vegan. Megamart also has Soya margarine and ""Smart Balance"" butterflavored spread on occasion. My advice is to stock up when they have it! Also be careful when buying bread; as many have milk as an ingredient. I haven't found any dairy-free cheese in doha. Is the allergy just cow's milk? Can goat or sheep cheese be used? The pharmacy in City Center has chewy bears calcium vitamins if you are looking for supplements. Good luck."	0

Examine the fillets closely; and remove any scales and bones missed by the fishmonger. Fry some finely chopped onion until soft; then add crushed garlic; diced carrot and celery; with a little salt. Cover and sweat for five minutes. Add about 500mL vegetable stock and simmer until the vegetables are cooked. Remove the vegetables with a sieve; then cook the fish fillets in the simmering stock until the flesh has set (no more than 10 minutes). Serve the fish and vegetables with creamy mashed potato.	0

Q246	Q246_R41_C3	Can i open a bank account? i am wondering if i can open a bank account as i am on visit visa.	1 - If you leave with any bank debts/credit card debts/bad checks; this will create a problem for your sponsor. In that case the sponsor might blacklist you from getting a work visa in Qatar or anywhere else in the GCC. Additionally if there are issues with the bank; they may send a collection agency after you even in your home country to recover any money that you owe. 2 - There could be problems; it depends on point 1. 3 - The bank account will technically remain active. It doesn't close down at the expiration of your RP; otherwise all Qatar residents would need to go to the bank every time they renew their RP. If you have a monthly account fee over time this will bring the account into negative balance; creating a potential problem for you and your sponsor. Leave peacefully and do the right thing by your sponsor. If you leave by going on holiday and not coming back you are only going to make a problem for yourself later.	0

Q247	Q247_R41_C2	Is there any Art college here in qatar? Is there any art college here in qatar? If there is then call me 66693196. And what are the requirements??	"QUESTIONS OF LABELING (excerpt from wiki) Some who reject the label Baptist prefer to be labeled as Christians who attend Baptist churches. Also; a recent trend (most common among megachurches and those embracing the ""seeker movement"") is to eliminate ""Baptist"" from the church name; as it is perceived to be a ""barrier"" to reaching persons who have negative views of Baptists; whether they be of a different church background or none The label denomination is rejected by some because of the local autonomous governance system used by Baptist churches. Being a denomination is viewed by them as having a hierarchy that substitutes for the Roman Catholic Church. Another reason for the rejection of the label is the influence of the Restoration period on Baptist churches; which emphasized a tearing down of denominational barriers."	0

Places have been filled by now and waiting lists will have been updated.

Have a look at schools suitable to your 'requirements'; but be aware that the more waiting lists you join; the better chance you have to get a place. But first you need to get here as no school will give you a chance to even join the waiting list if you are not physically in Qatar.	0

I even went to thailand and trained kickboxing there in the Fiartex camp i stayed there a long time basically life was training all day. I came across Krav Maga when i first started Jui Jitsu; there was a guy teaching it in town and it got alot of hype it was very effectively advertized in the united states and it attracted many people of the age-group 21years+ ; I think the organization made most of its money selling single women a false-sense of security in that if they learnt this they could take on any person in a dark parking lot.

I would suggest that you boil the tap water and use for drinking or run the tap water through a filtration process system such as Aqua Guard or Brittanica. Agents are here in Doha who would give you a demonstration and I understand the system costs you around 2000riyals but you have the liberty to pay in installments. But I have seen the demonstration and you would see the difference what a tap water or mineral water (any brand) offers. The results are amazing and am sure that you would forget all this mineral water and opt for this system. Unfortunately I dont ahve th nos. of these filtration company agent personnel numbers. whenever I get it; I shall surely post it . cheers Bob.	1

I see a lot of people have already written a reasonable answer; but keep in mind following: - about flat or car rental - depends who negotiates. If a European person or a westerner in general - forget it to find those rates. For them everything is double. - as many have mentioned - depends on lifestyle. For example one of the most difficult issues for women here - to find a normal hairdresser; beautician; etc. usually too expensive and very low quality / level of hygiene. If you go to a normal place - prices are ridiculous for what you get.	1

Q249	Q249_R51_C1	What's your favorite life quotation? What's your favorite life quotation?	It is a very rare Qatari man that would want anything more than what you just described. It is a very rare man in Qatar that wants anything more to do with a Western girl than you just described. Meeting men here is like stepping through a minefield. 9 out of 10 of them just want sex. And they will do and say anything to get it from you. I am not bitter; I do not hate men; but I have been living in various parts of Asia for the last 2 and a half years. Trust me when I say if you do not want to get burned be VERY careful who you date. Asian opinion of Western women is not very high when it comes to sex and dating. Tell Sunny to stop advertising online for a date and come here and get the lay of the land first.	0

Q249	Q249_R51_C3	What's your favorite life quotation? What's your favorite life quotation?	I must tell you redcajun504 Arab youths can go to any extent to get sex; but so is men from any country. Men have always sex on mind. It is always advisable to be cautious. But why are you worrying? There is a huge expat population here; which includes Indians; Europeans; Americans and even Australians. So; it's not a problem basically. Ask Sunny to be prudent and approach the things casually; without any pre-conceived notions; though caution is utmost required. You never know you may actually get a gem of person among these Arabians. After all; many of them have married Westerners. But dohagirl as such is correct that youths here always look for sex. On my own experience I must tell you they see Russians; Lebanese and Filipinos as someone always available for sex. Actually; this part of the world has many prostitutes from these communities; thronging star hotels. Use your common sense and things will be cozier for you. I wish you and your sister best of luck.

Q249	Q249_R51_C4	What's your favorite life quotation? What's your favorite life quotation?	Life is not easy if you are a Western Woman; and the main reason a man from this part of the world would want a western woman is mainly for sex. However; please do not for one moment think that the men and women here con't have premarital relationships - they do it just not talked about and it is not caried out in the open. Due to the conservative background of the boys they will always return to their families and it would be vry difficult for them to marry outside the families would not be happy about it. I think it is much better to be very cautious out here although there are a great many handsome men and they can be very charming going through the Arab and Asian world of men they are all interested in SEX. One of the things is that being found to be together whoc ae not married can get into very deep trouble here - just a little food for thought.	0
Q249	Q249_R51_C5	What's your favorite life quotation? What's your favorite life quotation?	Sadly this has been the case for many years. Maybe it originally stems from the days when arabs had loads of money; visited capital cities (mainly in the West) and were naturally surrounded (as they were rich) by hookers. Word spread when they returned that they had been with western women. The assumption would then be made that all Western women were loose. That is the assumption that we came to many years ago. Rather like the Western men going to Thailand	0

It is a very rare Western man that would want anything more than what you just described. It is a very rare man in the West that wants anything more to do with a Asian girl than you just described. Its impossible to believe that the thousands of crippled shaking 70 year old Western men moving with 21 year old Asian beauties do so...because the guy was so romantic; loving and responsible that the girl fell head over heals in love with him.. I have seen Western men in various parts of Asia for the last 2 and a half years. Trust me when I say if you do not want to get burned be VERY careful who you date.

At least they are rich and handsome; and donÂ´t get completely drunkenly smashed in public; so donÂ´t worry about dating them. Thing is; if you behave like a slut;all men will treat you like a slut.

"for banks to reduce their interest rates per QCB's circular. No ifs or buts. The QCB is the governing body of banks. Wikipedia: ""...The primary function of a central bank is to provide the nation's money supply; but more active duties include controlling interest rates (i.e.; price fixing ); and acting as a lender of last resort to the banking sector during times of financial crisis (e.g.; bailouts ). It may also have supervisory powers; intended to prevent banks and other financial institutions from reckless or fraudulent behaviour. Central banks in most developed nations are independent in that they operate under rules designed to render them free from political interference."" If your bank has not reduced its interest rates; then they fall under 'fraudalent behaviour'; which would make them liable."	1

On personal loans; I am not sure but banks take time before issuing them. Banking here is different from the west. when you arrive to work here your company usually has facilities with certain banks so you can only take facilities from those banks (you can open in any bank a savings account but you will not get any facilities with it). some of the larger companies can send your salary to any bank and then it is up to you to choose. Note that Vehicle loans tend to be straight forward as the bank co-owns your vehicle until you pay your loan back however; personal loans take more time (at least a couple of month where your salary is transferred regularly) before it is approved. Here; there is no credit history that you can transfer with you. it is all about where your salary gets transferred and which company is sponsoring you. Bottom line; don't bother with researching any oth.....	0

Well I think it’s a rip off. No such thing as the best bank. I left Doha Bank because of poor customer service and went to QNB which am happy with. With QNB; you have to have a minimum of Qr 3;000 in your current account always. It’s a compulsory savings scheme. Plus; you get .25% in your savings account and if you take out a mortgage loan you pay 8.5%. Be careful; read the small prints. I don't trust banks here.	0

Any info from when this will effect and it is mandatory to all the Banks ( As i heard from my friend QNB already confirm they reduce the interest therefore loan repayment period has reduce) What a relief if this true????	CBQ with no doubt. Their range of services and their network are really convenient for customers add to this their accurate customer service. CBQ is the best bank in Qatar when it comes to a number of services like Online; call center. (I also have account in QNB and I know quite well about Doha Bank) IBQ doesn't have online service at all. Network; CBQ is the bank that has the widest presence in malls (Hyatt; Villagio; city center; lulu HM; Landmark) with all convenience this brings to customers in terms of proximity and working hours. Customer service in CBQ is better than that of QNB and Doha bank. I'm not talking about people who smile only but about their accuracy and professionalism as well. They may be less flexible than other banks but for me personally I preferred their services over all other banks (and I have dealt with many of them)	1

Any info from when this will effect and it is mandatory to all the Banks ( As i heard from my friend QNB already confirm they reduce the interest therefore loan repayment period has reduce) What a relief if this true????	CBQ is the best; I have accounts in QNB; Standard Chartered & Doha Bank. Call center agents of CBQ are really professionals and very well trained staff. They have a excellent telephone manners. Doha bank call center very poor; I always feel like I'm not welcome to ask any questions for what else I want to know. Sometimes they need to transfer to another agent but I'm not satisfied of their answers regarding my problem. Standard Chartered bank is trying too much to be the best but I'm sorry to them they are very far from CBQ call center. They register me to receive sms if ever any transactions made from my account. Only one time I receive sms from them. QNB is one of the worst; I've issued cheques for my car loan and I have agreement with the person responsible for my cheques but still it's nothing. What's funny with this guy; he act that he type something in the computer and promise it will not happened anymore. How disgusting!. http://www.lizaqat.blogspot.com	1

Any info from when this will effect and it is mandatory to all the Banks ( As i heard from my friend QNB already confirm they reduce the interest therefore loan repayment period has reduce) What a relief if this true????	Just an update.... I do have a fixed rate loan apparently it means nothing to them. I should feel better that this change is across the board; 'for everybody; new and exsisting loans'(in case I felt left out; I suppose). What was really amusing was how I was told this is an International Bank (???) and keeps up with the markets hence interest rates can go up and down. I don't seem to recall them going down when the US Dollar hit rock bottom!!! Also regarding not informing me about the increase....'we have 1000's of customers we can't tell everybody!' I wish I could say they were saving the environment by not sending out letters but what's the excuse for not sending an email or text? Anyway long story short; I'm moving banks and am very glad to; good riddance to old rubbish. I do wish I could meet the people who gave them all those awards for 'Excellence in banking' etc we must not be talking about the same Doha Bank. Goodluck to all those who continue to bank with them.	0

Vegas... re-read the post; nothing to do with late payment; just a general across-the-board increase in interest rates. Basically the bank trying to squeeze every penny out of people (especially those who have being paying on time; because this would mean they have the money; no use trying to get money out of someone who doesn't have it)to cover any losses they may have sustained while 'playing' the markets.	0

GK; u have see what exactly u want from ur bank; what's ue requirements and what's important to u? the min balance? branch near ur house? good internet/phone banking? product range (apart from standard debit and credit card stuff)? interest rate on ur savings and deposits? investment products? best customer service? nobody can really give u a proper answer if u will come and ask which bank is the best in here :o) If you're looking for a problem; you're probably gonna find one.	0

Hi Casanova; I'm sorry to disappoint you with this; HSBC is just like any other bank in Doha; and it's even worse because they charge for every thing. Don't be amused by this word (The World's Local Bank); they are right in it's local; but it's not universal. you can ask them about something to do with another HSBC world wide; they will tell you: sorry; there is no networks between our banks in the world; so it's just local bank. I'm telling you this; since I'm dealing with five different bank in Qatar; and HSBC was even lower level than others; it's just a big name; the only good thing about them; that they provide you parking in the main branch in Banks street. I think Doha; Almashreq; and the commercial banks are better options. Best regards	0

"As a woman here in Qatar; I encountered the same problem when I moved here last year...I was told ""long sleeves and long skirts"". That is not entirely true; esp. in the summer when the heat is unbearable. Your wife can wear capris (knees do need to be covered) and short-sleeved tops as long as the neckline isn't too low. The benefit to long summer skirts is that they are actually cooler than pants. The general rule is that it shouldn't be too tight or two revealing. Also; keep in mind that they run the A/c on high everywhere; so your wife will probably want to keep a cardigan with her to wear around on top of short sleeves when she is in restaurants; malls; etc. You are arriving in October; so the weather will be fine; like spring weather in the States; very pleasant actually. Last winter it actually got quite cold here; so bring jackets and even a light-weight winter coat (or heavier if you intend to travel during winter).

Q251	Q251_R27_C2	"The Wear House Can any one guide me about ""The Wear House"" its location and about stuff I can get from there."	surfcatgolferdude. cover up is not normal here for expatriates. covered shoulders and covered knees is not a must. Let your wife relax. Think of it here as a conservative western country.

I recommend that she wear ""normal"" clothes; this is totally acceptable for ""western ladies"". And at a club or at home anything. But when you go around to a supermarket or shopping mall I recommend she wears a little more covered up. This is not because of the Islamic point of view; but more for her own protection.

Yup selection is awful; and prices are ouch. Have you tried H&M? They did have many trousers; price range was 160-250Qar. The other thing to do would be to invest in good pair of basic colour trousers and get your tops stitched.	0

Q251	Q251_R28_C3	"The Wear House Can any one guide me about ""The Wear House"" its location and about stuff I can get from there."	I tried H&M and their selection was ok. The only problem were the pants had this new fangled design where the waist is supposed to sit below your waist and it felt like my pants were about to fall down. Just too hip and cool for me. I'm old and I need mom jeans! :-) I will try BHS. I'm used to Target and discount stores. The idea of paying $80-$100 for a pair of pants that I will wear for 6 months is impossible. Checked online; shipping from Motherhood Maternity from the States is $70 for a ton of clothes. I think I will just do that.... Thanks ladies!

Q251	Q251_R28_C5	"The Wear House Can any one guide me about ""The Wear House"" its location and about stuff I can get from there."	hi Minoush; you will have to go to Mothercare at CC; because apparently all maternity wear from other MC shops are to shift to MC of CC; if not already there. You need to visit the MC inside Debenhams. The locals wear the abbaya; so a loose gown inside ( the jalabiyas; more like the house maxis) is not visible to anybody. Among Asian clothes there are many loose tops in style right now; with lycra tights; so again no problems there. Getting T's is not an issue; as long as you are okay with it hugging you tight all day. The trouser style; is the low bump style right now; and it doesnt really fall off.H&M had the high waist trousers. not sure about baby shop for Maternity clothes; else you may have to try the large clothes section; like Evans; if you are looking for comfy tops. Check Giordano as well; they dont have maternity; but they usually have these loose comfy linen trousers that you can tie under the bump.	0

Q251	Q251_R30_C9	"The Wear House Can any one guide me about ""The Wear House"" its location and about stuff I can get from there."	just my 5 cent worth of opinion: not all the things you need; you should buy abroad just because they are more expensive in doha. i wouldnt buy a baby cot and brought it over to doha. likewise for diapers (pampers). how many packs of pampers can you buy from abroad for a good one year supply; just because they might be cheaper abroad. my opinion is you should consider buying things; which are not in Qatar; from your home country. even if you try to avoid paying more on baby stuff; you will eventually spend more on something else out here and at the same time paying less for other things too; like car and petrol.	0

Q252	Q252_R3_C10	Where can i buy cheap ticket going to dubai? Me and my friend planning to go to UAE this coming eid; thats why im looking for a cheaper ticket?	Amadeo; Sharjah to Dubai is really just 25 minutes travel by car if there is no traffic at the National Paint area. Traffic starts from 7 to 9am and from 5 to 8pm during week days. There is a short cut to avoid traffic if the driver knows it. But I don't suggest the OP to go for Air Arabia as it has only slight difference with the air ticket rates compared with the Fly Dubai. Sometimes; FlyDubai is even cheaper (if you dont have baggage to check-in) and it is convenience to any means of transportation...you can take bus; taxi or metro.	0
Q252	Q252_R6_C1	Where can i buy cheap ticket going to dubai? Me and my friend planning to go to UAE this coming eid; thats why im looking for a cheaper ticket?	Although you can go to dubai and get visa on arrival if you are going by air but road travel is different. You have to pass Saudi border and you need saudi visa. In order to get saudi visa you have to get UAE visa first. Saudi gives visa only after you already have UAE visa on your passport. Hope this clarifies.	0

Q252	Q252_R8_C9	Where can i buy cheap ticket going to dubai? Me and my friend planning to go to UAE this coming eid; thats why im looking for a cheaper ticket?	Fly Dubai really sucks. Their airport staff seems to have no clue about Dubai immegration procedures and can easily ban any passenger from boarding. the airport counter has no supervisor to talk to; in case of any conflict and their main office staff are worse in cooperation. I had a similar situation where they did not allow me to board as my RP had only 2.5 months expiry date. I purchased a ticked on Qatar Airways and got an arrival visa at Dubai without any problem. Fly Dubai was not convinced and they seemed did not want to listen and escaped from paying back the ticket cost. I desided to use a good reputed carrier even with double or tripple ticket fare rather than facing such irresponsible situation at the last moment.	0

Me and my friend planning to go to UAE this coming eid; thats why im looking for a cheaper ticket?	h! dear As far as i know you can easily get a tourist visa easily but the difficult part is entering/passing Philippine immigration. I would suggest to ask someone from qatar to play as sponsor in behalf of ur fiancee; much better if its a woman bcoz Qatar culture doesn't tolerate such things that a guy will sponsor a girl without any immediate relation. in addition to; the Phil. immigration might ask u for additional docs like sponsor letter; bank statement; show money; married cert if your married etc. just to satisfy them that ur genuine visitor in the country. I will advice u to go to an agency so they could help u find an sponsor.	0

I left Doha Bank because of poor customer service and went to QNB which am happy with. With QNB; you have to have a minimum of Qr 3;000 in your current account always. It’s a compulsory savings scheme. Plus; you get .25% in your savings account and if you take out a mortgage loan you pay 8.5%. Be careful; read the small prints. I don't trust banks here.	1

Hi Lamea! im kinda new in here but what I know about islamic banking is that they got much lower rates and a certain portion is donated to their Muslim Communities who need help - gotta think from the more positive angle since we are living in their world we gotta live by it. Otherwise go to America or Europe instead but for me Islam and Islamic banking is good. Just a thought. No offense meant ok? Cheers!

Fact : If your company terminates you; take that letter to your bank ; you won't be required to pay any remaining amount ; bank will use its tacts ; don't yield ; after few days of delay ; finally you will get clearance from bank and fly home .. Insurer of your money / bank would pay that amount to bank; may be insurer and bank are having offices in the same building / or managers are cousins / they are after your money / so escape clear from both parties / Pray hard / Good luck in finding another job soon somewhere / Regards.	0

Hi Casanova; I'm sorry to disappoint you with this; HSBC is just like any other bank in Doha; and it's even worse because they charge for every thing. Don't be amused by this word (The World's Local Bank); they are right in it's local; but it's not universal. you can ask them about something to do with another HSBC world wide; they will tell you: sorry; there is no networks between our banks in the world; so it's just local bank. I'm telling you this; since I'm dealing with five different bank in Qatar; and HSBC was even lower level than others; it's just a big name; the only good thing about them; that they provide you parking in the main branch in Banks street. I think Doha; Almashreq; and the commercial banks are better options. Best regards	1

Their range of services and their network are really convenient for customers add to this their accurate customer service. CBQ is the best bank in Qatar when it comes to a number of services like Online; call center. (I also have account in QNB and I know quite well about Doha Bank) IBQ doesn't have online service at all. Network; CBQ is the bank that has the widest presence in malls (Hyatt; Villagio; city center; lulu HM; Landmark) with all convenience this brings to customers in terms of proximity and working hours. Customer service in CBQ is better than that of QNB and Doha bank. I'm not talking about people who smile only but about their accuracy and professionalism as well. They may be less flexible than other banks but for me personally I preferred their services over all other banks (and I have dealt with many of them)	1

Call center agents of CBQ are really professionals and very well trained staff. They have a excellent telephone manners. Doha bank call center very poor; I always feel like I'm not welcome to ask any questions for what else I want to know. Sometimes they need to transfer to another agent but I'm not satisfied of their answers regarding my problem. Standard Chartered bank is trying too much to be the best but I'm sorry to them they are very far from CBQ call center. They register me to receive sms if ever any transactions made from my account. Only one time I receive sms from them. QNB is one of the worst; I've issued cheques for my car loan and I have agreement with the person responsible for my cheques but still it's nothing. What's funny with this guy; he act that he type something in the computer and promise it will not happened anymore. How disgusting!. http://www.lizaqat.blogspot.com	1

Many people do not know this procedure and stick with the job. The only thing is that they may charge ur flight & visa exp. from ur settlement. I slightly differ with Mr. HR Manager ! u can protect the employer's interest by penalizing the guy the money they spent for employing these people. many unlucky guys land here with bad employer without fulfillig promises and unsuitable working environment which may compell them to leave. so let them leave and search for something they they feel good.	1

I have a question my self & it is related here though I already posted it to questions & answers but it seems no one is really visiting that part of QL so... My company got this habit of delaying people from the date of resignation so they obviously knows about the two weeks max limit of Qatar labor code's article 57.

Also employees who have completed 5 years or more need to serve 2 months notice. the company is liable to pay only the notice period; the pending vacation balance if any and the indemnity calculated on the last earned basic salary. hope this helps	1

In your case u said that you are working for the last 6 years here in Qatar with a gross salary of QR.5000/month. So let us assume your date of joining is January 01; 2004 and your basic salary is QR.4000. If so; the calculation is as follows: 01.01.2004 to 31.12.2011 = 21x8 = 168 Days So your gratuity is calculated as = 4000x168x12/365 = QR.22;093.15 Apart from this; your employer should provide a ticket to your home country. The notice period up to 5 five years from the date of joining is 1 month and above that; 2 months. In your case the notice period is 2 months. Gratuity/indemnity is settled net of any staff receivables/recoveries.	1

I don’t think you will immediately adjust to the country. It takes years when things go right; but at the moment life isn't easy there (high unemployment and huge tax loads).

Take leave (don't disclose the reason to your employer) and go there to assess personally the situation. Good luck!	1

They base their families there and continue working in the Gulf with higher packages (because of the new passport). So; it all comes down to what your REAL intentions are.

So they might give you the offer; but they cannot provide you the visa to come here. So just wait for their go-ahead before you resign from your current job.	1

Q255	Q255_R7_C3	Hotels in Bangkok So the question is easy: What Hotel would you recommend to stay in/to avoid in Bangkok? thanks	Thailand has two coasts and two rainy seasons. If it's dry in Phuket it's raining in Koh Samui and vice versa. If you choose the right resort hotel/location you won't get masses of tourists or the bar girl scene. I really like Thailand (going myself in three weeks) because it's so darn inexpensive. I plan to feast and sleep for next to nothing! My hotels in Bangkok and Siem Reap are about $40/night. I have stayed in the 5-star places (Peninsula; Shangri-la) but I know these little boutique places and they are just fine for my girlfriend from the US and myself. It's a chicks' holiday! And there are the cutest and tastiest Thai restaurants available that I swear have better food than the big hotels. Mandi	1
Q255	Q255_R7_C4	Hotels in Bangkok So the question is easy: What Hotel would you recommend to stay in/to avoid in Bangkok? thanks	Hmm.. that sounds like the right holiday for me. Give me a little cabin somewhere. Get out of bed at a certain time; read in the hammock or another cozy place; off to some breadfast; back in the hammock; roll into the sea for snorkeling or swimming; back relaxing; go for a little walk looking at animals or plants; back relaxing... maybe a little half day excursion once in a while but nothing too long; and a simple dinner somewhere in the evening. Perfect relaxing. I definitely don't need a luxurious huge resort. Hmm.. if we decide for Thailand; can I contact you for accommodation advice?	0

Q255	Q255_R11_C4	Hotels in Bangkok So the question is easy: What Hotel would you recommend to stay in/to avoid in Bangkok? thanks	I went to Thailand for 3 weeks at Christmas/New Year and visited a few different places; but if you only have 5 days then you'll probably only be able to do one place. Bangkok is probably your best bet as I expect that's where you're flying to/from; and it has plenty to do for 5 days. The Lonely Planet has plenty of good suggestions of what to do; but I can give you more specific ideas if you want. We also went to Chiang Mai in the north which is lovely. Still a city with lots to see in and around it; but it seems to have a far more chilled vibe than Bangkok. If you fancy proper chilling then I'd recommend down south. We stayed on the Andaman coast at Khao Lak and Ko Lanta (north and south of Phuket respectively). Both had a nice relaxed atmosphere - not as manic as I'm led to believe Phuket is. 	0

These sites usually have a great line up of hotels and their basic rates with facilities available including their pictures. Once you have identified the hotel you would like to stay in; search for the hotel name on google and book the rooms from the hotel website. Majority of hotels offer best rates available in the market thru their own website.

Q255	Q255_R20_C1	Hotels in Bangkok So the question is easy: What Hotel would you recommend to stay in/to avoid in Bangkok? thanks	I think SALOONS usually; if they are of the 1950s barber look they offer a head massage; shave and haircut for 15-20 qr; albeit I have never had the full tratment myself so cant advise which one; there are so many anyway. What is the deal with them calling them SALOON. Did they think a SALON is for women and since they had seen (Western) films {i.e. cowboy ones) with men going into SALOONS that is the male name equivelant??? and everyone else has followed suit since. Nice man saloon; pretty saloon; and my favourite BOEUTY (something like that) SALOON; the last one would be a good name for a strpiclub cum nightclub. About massage parlours; i think most of them are men2men but there are a few exceptions check with the major hotels???	0
Q255	Q255_R20_C2	Hotels in Bangkok So the question is easy: What Hotel would you recommend to stay in/to avoid in Bangkok? thanks	Hi; N-M; I recently posted a similar question (http://www.qatarliving.com/node/1615). Recently I visited the Chinese Health Center and they were quite inexpensive and did a good job. They work on both male and female (separate sections; of course). From what I understand men are worked on by men; women by women. My hubbie and I are returning tonight. :) Being new here this is the only info I've scrounged up so far: Filipino Massage Center - Gents - 4550600 Hitec Massage - 4667287 International Massage Center - 4421343 Kottakkal Massage Center - 4360061 Chinese Health Center - 465-4773 Also; try the different hotels in the area - Marriott; Sheraton; etc. Good luck.	1
Q255	Q255_R20_C3	Hotels in Bangkok So the question is easy: What Hotel would you recommend to stay in/to avoid in Bangkok? thanks	"Thank you to both Laudgi7 and Practor. It is wonderful here to see that we have varieties of barbers to choose from : Indian; Sri lankan; Bangladeshi; Lebanese; Turkish; Philippino; etc; etc..........i guess we have to try them all to see the uniqueness of each. I guess the rest whom have had been frequenting each of these barbers can share their experiences. I heard some people said Sri lankan is the best in Head Massage; not sure though if that is true. Anyway; I tried the massage in Chinese Health Center; it is OK; can score 6.5/10. I tried both at their Main Center in D Ring Rd and the Branch in Gharrafa. The Main Center charged QR 100/hour and the Gharrafa branch charged QR 80/hour.....strange huh....for the same quality of massage. I was calling the Thai Massage Center (got their number from their ad in local newspaper)....apparently they're closed for 2 weeks....when i asked why; the guy answered the phone was telling me ""My Manager is on holiday in Thailand; so we have to close....."	0

Q255	Q255_R26_C10	Hotels in Bangkok So the question is easy: What Hotel would you recommend to stay in/to avoid in Bangkok? thanks	Why not try somewhere totally exotic in South East Asia. Thailand; Vietnam; or Malaysia caters from the 5 star to budget travellers. Air fares with Qatar Airways is approx QR3;000 to Thailand; you may find cheaper fares with Gulf Air; leaving you QR 2;000 for hotels etc. Take a look at Air Asia's web site. It is SE Asia's budget airline and can fly you cheaply and connecting you to nearby neighbouring countries and has many hotel prices listed too. If time is not an issue you can also take the bus from say Malaysia to Thailand; or Thailand to Vietnam or Cambodia. Best of luck	1

Just watch out for the following characteristics. a) The males will have long flowing beard (Look at my avatar for an idea about how it would look); which will be always unkempt and unruly. If there is a bird which has nested in his beard; that means he is the most senior among them and also the wisest. I tried to make a nest in my beard and invite a bird in; but none would touch it. I wonder why? b) b) The females will almost always have flowing; shiny; silver hair and they will have eyes lined in VIBGYOR – all colours of the rainbow. The more colours they have around their eyes; the more senior in QL they are. Age does not come in here. All of them are very young and nubile. Its very easy to find them in a crowded place because if two QL ladies get together; they will start singing “my heart will go on” at the top of their voices. c) HABITAT They are usually found near beaches and shopping malls where they go away for their hunting.....	0

Each time he shook hands with a person; two birds came out through the two sides of his beard singing ""cuckoo; cuckoo"". I envied him. I didnt have even ONE bird in my beard while he had two. I also saw a few bisuit crumbs on his beard. I have a strong suspicion that he is using Britania bisuits to lure the birds into his beard. I have made a proposal to the birds saying that i would give them swiss chocolate biscuits if they relocated. Lets see how the negotiations go. Will have to stamp their RP's very soon so that they dont leave me anytime soon. Note to self: Give birds Residence permit; land cruiser allowance; two way tickets (even if they can fly on their own) and a free hand in doing what they will with their nest s; provided it will ALWAYS remain within MY beard!"	0

Nice to meet you; hope your move goes well. It can be difficult finding things to occupy your time here; especially when you're new. I'm not sure where you're going to be living? I live in an apartment block with my husband and it has no communal areas so have found it hard to meet and get to know my neighbours. I think compound life is a bit more sociable? Anyway - a couple of ideas... The Intercontinental Hotel (the one near Katara; not Intercont. the City) has a special offer on Tuesdays and Wednesdays - ladies pay only 50 QR to access their pool / pool area. I take yoga classes with Yama Yoga http://yamayogastudios.com - they are lovely and might be another way to meet people? Also; not sure what nationality / language your wife speaks but there are a number of associations for different nationalities here. Buy a copy of Marhaba magazine when you arrive - they have an up to date list of them with contact details - so she could socialise with people who speak her language.	0

Q257	Q257_R3_C3	what do you miss? what would you load up on? Hi; Getting ready for the move over and I was wondering if anyone has any tips on things you really can not get in Doha that 'at home' is just readily available. Someone mentioned cough syrup and tampons. Anything esle?	The only thing i can tell you is that someone from Guinea is miss-calling you... As far as I know there are multiple case where someone miss-calls and you call back and then your phone load is gone or you get charged a lot if you have a subscription. But as far as i know; now there are security measures in place to prevent this from happening. But that doesn't mean that they do not happen anyway :) Just be careful and don't call back. Send an email to Qtel or Vodafone and tell them about your problem. Normally they should be able to help (block the phone number from calling again). I'm not sure but i think you can also do that from your phone...	0

If they want to talk to you they will call again. It could be a trap. There are lots of mafia who are doing cloning of sim cards and using it for illegal purposes. If you call back your sim could get cloned and will be used by them for illegal activities which could lead you to great trouble. If you are getting missed calls from unknow numbers just ignore it for being safe.	0

However; it is an extremely small town and really only used for the oil and gas industry. You would probably find your self coming to Doha on the weekends. See if you can stay in Doha as it is only a 30 to 40min commute in the morning.	0

Someone mentioned cough syrup and tampons. Anything esle?	The school in Al Khor is good; well-equipped and has a happy staff. In fact everything for the expat community is well-equipped and there's a very nice club with a lot of social activities; besides lots of home-partying. Neverthless; it has a sleepy feel which can irritate and some of the teens; I gather; get a bit disgruntled. Playing the singles game might be tricky. Imagine a very orderly English suburb with no pub and a 60 minute drive to the nearest bar or off-licence; but with plenty of dance classes and bridge tournaments and stuff. Many people love it; some can't stand it.	0

All the foreigners I know in Al Khor live in 'The community'; a large compound between Al Khor proper and Ras Lafan which has one school; and one social club etc. I had thought housing and club membership was provided by the various employers. It's about 40 minutes drive from the North end of Doha to al Khor. Warning! I don't live there; though I have visited and have pals there.	0

Hi;Canadian Luda Moving to Qatar in mid-August is a no no.But if you have no choice...Why do I say that??Because the weather is awful.But once you get to Oct-Nov. you will enjoy it. Regarding the shipment;there is no point in doing that since the company will provide you with a fully furnished appartment/villa.You will find everything here(house-holds;china;etc)at a reasonable price. Visa-it depends on how fast the company you will be working for is. What to expect when you arrive??hhhmm...difficult question.A lot of dust;heat and a lot of humidity :) I don't know how much you know about Qatar.But if you have any questions just let me know.

Someone mentioned cough syrup and tampons. Anything esle?	tough time to move. I moved in August as well. but atleast you can comfort yourself in knowing you're hitting the worst weather by that time and its only positive from then on. Quick addition: I do suggest you actually move with stuff... especially if you and your partner are doing this together. clothing is expensive here and if it's just 'your own stuff' that you want around the house; pack a few boxes of clothes you want; pics; music or books or whatever. everything retail and consumable is expensive. As for a moving company.... I've used Crown Relocations on all of my last 3 moves between countries and they are top notch in every place. Visa stuff... let the employer take are of that. I can recommend that you have at minimum 2 certified and originals of all legal documents (birth certs; marriage certs; etc.)... it is easier if you need them later on than having to wait to obtain them. Plus; if you can even get one of each certified by the Qatar consulate in Canada before you go (yo.....	0

I do listen to radio 4 FM 89.1 and city FM 101.6 but we do not get them all year round. Only when the weather is calm and not windy. We don't get it all during the winter. It is a very good suggestion and I do believe Qatar should have its own 24 hour hindi FM channel. If we can have 24 hour English channel on FM 97.5 for the last 30 plus years in Qatar then why not a Hindi channel????	0

Someone mentioned cough syrup and tampons. Anything esle?	How many Asian guys do you see over here; sheer weight of numbers; I would think. Ok but my fiancee thinks its because the asian girls here are more westernised and therefore would have more in common with them. Also there are alot of Asian Girls dating Asian Guys here; perhaps you just don't see them; trust me she is Korean and would know the numbers. Perhaps you don't notice an Asian/Asian couple but notice an Asian white match more because it sticks in your brain. I have seen loads of Fillipino Couples out together; and I am told that Fillipino girls would much rather go out with Fillipino boys here as they have more in common and are not just trated as sex objects which we know many Arab guys do.	0

So to answer the question; i'm not certain if you are inquiring about Airlines policy or government visa policy.... If its the former; best thing to do is call QATAR AIRWAYS and ask them. If it's the latter; then maybe there's a government agency you can ask? When my daughter was born (here in Doha); she didn't travel till she was 6 months old; but we were told the law was that she had to have a residency Visa within a month of being born....so by the time she travelled she had it. Hope that helps somewhat; and good luck. Stay safe all. Perfection does not exist. The question therefore; is: what level of imperfection are we willing to settle for?	0

Fact : If your company terminates you; take that letter to your bank ; you won't be required to pay any remaining amount ; bank will use its tacts ; don't yield ; after few days of delay ; finally you will get clearance from bank and fly home ..

No because the Syrians can tell that you have been in Israel by the entry stamp you've got at the Jordan bordercrossing. Can I travel to Israel and Syria over land useing two passport's? No because then you'll have one passport with an entry stamp from Jordan and an exit stamp in your other passport?!

One in Bangkok from their Hotel room and one in Malaysia from their backpack. I Just wanted to know what do you all normally do?	I dont think it is necessary to have 6 months validity while you hold a valid Residence Permit. 6 months validity of a PP is required if you are travelling to a country without having a valid visa for that country and you will not get a visa if you does not have 6 months valid Passport as well. In this case I would suggest you to renew your Passport before you go on leave as you do not have too many days left. You are planning to come back at the end of April and in case if you are not able to travel your Passport will get expired and you will be in trouble. So play safe.	0

So you will be on a business visa until your RP comes through all you have to do is tell your company when you are going and they will apply for a exit visa which is just a piece of paper really saying you are allowed to go and they will also get you the entrance visa for when you come back! You can go wher you like just remember to check if you need a visa for the other countries you wish to visit!

One in Bangkok from their Hotel room and one in Malaysia from their backpack. I Just wanted to know what do you all normally do?	Brit; I might have to disagree with you on this one. Cost of living in home countries? I can assure you that in India; some people have a REALLY high cost of living. Like anywhere else; you can get very similar foods/item for very cheap or very expensive. Depends on how rich you are and on your lifestyle. Average living standards and governmental services vary between a 3rd world country and Europe but that is it. Plus; if someone is living here; who cares how much a soda can costs back home? Why can't that person Mr (kumar) enjoys his weekend in Qatar like Mr (John) does with his family? I bet you Mr kumar's kids and wife would like to have gourmet food every once in a while. I am glad I am white. But nothing pisses me off more than Racism and especially when it gets acknowledged by those who benefit from it! :) you know better brit.	0

One in Bangkok from their Hotel room and one in Malaysia from their backpack. I Just wanted to know what do you all normally do?	Also BE; having worked in HR here for a while; it is common practise for companies to ask what your current salary is and they will base their offers on that. For instance; 2 Civil Engineers; one from the US and one from Philippines you will find that the one from the philppines will be on say 8000QAR and maybe the one from the states will be on 21QAR (in their home country). HR will base their offer on how much extra (or not) they can get away with offering above what they currently earn. So you can't give someone who is on 8kqar currently over 20k and similarly you cannot offer someone who is on 21k less than that because he thinks; why would I want to come here for less than I am currently earning at home. Also back to BE's point; rents; mortgages general cost of living in India and Philippines is much less than it is in most of Europe and North america. And lastly for those that say why not hire all from India etc because there is nothing more detrimental to a good company than hir.....	0

One in Bangkok from their Hotel room and one in Malaysia from their backpack. I Just wanted to know what do you all normally do?	what are we here for but to save for a better life when we go home. If someone cannot save for a better life when they go home; will simply not come in the first place and companies have slowly realised that hiring all from one nation does not work; so they have to pay more for a mix of people. However; what I have noticed is that people from say india who have lived in the ME a while; their salaries do start to become more equitable as they change jobs - based on their current salary and each time they change; voila; their salaries go up. What I also notice is that alot of westerners; their salaries do not change much; they were already being paid the top for what they are doing and cannot get much higher by changing jobs.	0

You should purchase an Electronic card of AED 100/- from the Bank counter for which they will charge AED 102/-.

I need to find out the average cost of water from a supermarket or other venue; and only the high end bottled water; like Evian. therfore; it should be the most expensive; and perferably in a glass bottle; if possible. Thank You.	I would suggest that you boil the tap water and use for drinking or run the tap water through a filtration process system such as Aqua Guard or Brittanica. Agents are here in Doha who would give you a demonstration and I understand the system costs you around 2000riyals but you have the liberty to pay in installments. But I have seen the demonstration and you would see the difference what a tap water or mineral water (any brand) offers. The results are amazing and am sure that you would forget all this mineral water and opt for this system. Unfortunately I dont ahve th nos. of these filtration company agent personnel numbers. whenever I get it; I shall surely post it . cheers Bob.	0

Thank You.	AL JAZEERA PURE DRINKING WATER is also the best. Their containers are all new. Their service staffs were polite. They have a timely deliveries so you wont worry wether you're out or still have spare containers left not consumed. They will only replenish your empty containers. No more to hurry for calling them at time you have water shortages. Besides; they are offering one(1) free standing Water Cooler dispenser for free upon your first time availment of buying 2 booklet water coupons. At a cost of QAR1100.00 for 200pcs 5-gallon bottles; it's worth more than a service and the pure healthy water. I just had availed of it two weeks ago; i have a new cooler dispenser now. Call them at TEl: 4509555 Fax: 4509444 or email them at: info@aljazeerawater.com for more queries; simply call ANWAR HUSSAIN with mobile: 6191064 for additional info.

Thank You.	yes; Hukk is right; nestle is not good with their service. infact; i came to know that manhal and nestle belongs to the same group. manhal does the filling for nestle; no wonder why they have such lousy service. to answer Mr.Vengal; i dont agree that manhal is the best; if u r using a dispenser with their bottle; you will be surprised to see red color plastic pieces inside the water tank and at times it is visible in your glass too when you pour the water out from the faucet. thats coz the red caps what they use on their bottles are not spill proof; when u put the bottle upside down on your dispenser; the cap gets punctured and blows into pieces and it ends up in your water. i guess only rayyan and sabeel uses spill proof caps; and hence its safe.	0

Water from tap is good to drink but due to pipeline and untidy water tanks in your apartment you might need to buy & install a Panasonic water purifier which i think is more enough to purify/fitler your tap water and start use that for drinking purposes. I have the two in my house; where I came in without knowing about Panasonic being installed as part of furnished stuff. It's better you avoid drinking botttled water; they are meant for immediate needs. Good Luck! I have an article about this; let me know your e-mail ID; so to e-mail you that stuff.	0

Thank You.	I understand; the bottled water which is meant for drinking is essentially desalinated through distillation and then processed with some mineral salts. Non-drinking water could be a mix of RO; distilled and recycled waste water. In this there could be chances of chemicals ( in very low concentations) which are meant to act as lubricants and anti-corrosion agents during reverse osmosis since these additives are not removed fully by the semi-permeable membrane. I don't know if consumption of these chemicals could be detrimental to health in the long run. Expert opinion is required.	0

Their prices are the same as taking an empty container to the market and dragging a full one back; but delivered to your door! My roommate also uses Wataniya; which for the first month is super service; multiple times a week. Then seems to not be so super. But that could be that they changed to one to two times a week delivery and my roommate never knew (he also puts them out too late when most of the service starts 6-8am). The differences between the two is Al Manhal sometimes delivers leaking overused bottles; and Wataniya's bottles almost 100% look brand new. Wataniya's taste isn't quite as good as Al Manhal's but still not bad at all.	1

"Just went to see how much it cost. Not that easy Im afraid. First you have to have a ""meeting"" with a marketing rep who puts you through a rigorous marketing questionaire. Then they take u on the tour of the place; and then will they only begin talking about the price. So after all that rubbish here it goes; and I shall attempt to simplify the overly confusing payment and membership options in 1 foul swoop. Silver and Gold; silver means you pay monthly 499 Qrl and another 1000 sign up and admin of around 250; plus a compulsory personal trainer session X3 (460ryl). But they insist you pay for the 12th month on sign up; obviously to ensure they get your money whether you stay the 12 mths or not. All told over 8000 ryl's for 12mnths. Now Gold; has no sign up; no admin and its only 459 ryl's a month; plus the same stupid compulsory personal trainer deal. 12mth's will be round 5900 ryl's. So either stupidly get silver and pay over 8000 or pay upfront and pay 6000. They clearly prfer u pay u....."	0

"Hello; Quitting is easier said than done for most smokers. I am like you until last year. Used to finish 20 sticks a day.Started this habit since 1987 until 2010. I tried sometimes to quit but usually they are either due to my girlfriend nagging or jus trying. Usually even with success on stopping for a week; I resume again; sometimes 3 months and picked up the habit. You will have to decide and discipline yourself. Even a puff.... From what I can remember; I used a combination of sub-concious method:- 1) I do not stick with one brand of cigarette switch around also between heavy and light ones but toward light ones more. And I by when I finish...never maintain a backup pack or reach from friends. (this has impact; I noticed almost immediately I hate the different brands and sometime even dislike the brand this is good cos you are still holding the cigarette but smoke less as you ""hate""d the taste) 2) Started some simple exercise like jogging or any sports (good preparation to clear yo....."	0

"Dear Friend; First of all let me tell you that there is nothing wihich can stop you from smoking other than your WILL TO GIVE UP SMOKING. You need to first understand what is the thing which make you smoke. 1. your mindset : It wants support! support of some kind which will give peace to your mind during tension / stress / anger etc. In case of smokers its ""smoking"" So you have to build your own support mechnism : like Music (which ever you like) any physical activiy like cycling; exercise; playing tennis ; football; swimming anything...and that u only can identify. 2. Nicotine Cycle / Levels of Nicotine in blood: This is the nicotine content in the blood which gets lowered and bue to which the necotine which is absorbed by your lungs enters into your blood through your lungs (alveolies) and carried into the blood stream through arteries to Heart and pumped to Brain through arteries. this whole process is called as Nicotine cycle. This nicotine when reaches you brain gives you FEELING ....."	0

"Its actually surprisingly EASY if you WANT to stop smoking!! I quit after nearly 23 years of smoking when I found out that I was pregnant. Years and years of my family nagging me; bribing me; beggin me ... always the fear of the ""side effects"" if I had to quit and the hard headed insistance that I liked smoking and it was my outlet from stress and yabba yabba ... I was honestly pissed off with myself when I did stop and the truth hit home how much damage I had done to myself and to my relationships for so long and all FOR NOTHING!! There was no cold turkey; no shakes; no cough; no sudden uncontrollable energy; no sudden weight gain; etc. etc. What did happen? Anxiety and stress LEFT!! And the smell of stale smoke and the taste of it became more repulsive than ever. And I suddenly was open to socialising with people that didn't smoke! It was actually annoyingly easy to stay quit!

Q265	Q265_R12_C8	I want to stop smoking I really want to stop smoking. I have tried almost everything except hypnotherapy. Does anyone know any good hypnotherapist here in Qatar? Thank you all.	I quit two years ago. Was quite tough. I used nicotine chewing gums for first few days. I still dream of smoking and feel I am just a millimeter (or a puff)away from being an addict again. Don't allow yourself even a single puff for me. Stay away from ambience which makes you feel like smoking. Quit one hundred percent. Don't give any concessions to yourself; be ruthless. Positives of quitting far outweigh the negatives. I did gain weight but reduced it as I could execise better now. Smoking anyway is outlawed almost everywhere. It's out of fashion too. I don't blame my previous generation for glorifying it as they did know less about the harms. If someone picks up the habit now or still continues with it then he or she definitely is an ignorant person. It makes you sick and smelly.	0

"Ok Dr. SMOKE is in the house. Fireheartin; look before you make such a big mistake of your life stop to reconsider this whole ""giving up"". What are you going to gain by giving up smoking? Live healthier? Live longer? lol these are all myths to giving up smoking just to make you feel better about yourself. Its not easy to give up smoking depending on how long you have been smoking. Also WHY! why put your body through such mental and physical stress to resist the urge to have that beautiful puff! let me list out a few advantages of smoking 1. Taking a crap in the morning is so much more relaxed and mentally soothing when your on the throne with a ciggie. Its just comes out better. 2. Say your the only guy who doesnt smoke and all your other friends smoke; you'll be looked as that ""loser"" guy. Your not a loser when you smoke; you make MORE friends when you smoke.

Thank you all.	fireheartin.. smoking patches available in most pharmacies. Nothing will help you quit smoking but yourself. I was a smoker 5+ years ago.. Here are my experiences: 1- I use to smoke 1 packet a day and reduced gradually to 4 cigs a day hoping that I will break free. THIS APPROACH FAILED. 2- Tried smoking patches. It ran my throat dry and I felt like hypnotised. Bad remedy really. THIS APPROACH FAILED. 3- Determination. When I use to smoke; i leave the office to smoke and interrupt work; i make my car smelling cigarrets; it destroyed my health and i become like a dog after running for a minute or so. So I decided to stop smoking no matter what because I said to myself that all consequences and health issues that affect me from smoking have to stop. This solution WORKED!!!

Find a good forwarder in the UK who could deliver your stuff door-to-door (that's DDP; Delivered Duty Paid for Incoterms 2000); so receiver should not worry about anything to pay as shipper will pay all the charges before it can be shipped out from the UK to Qatar.

My suggestion is that if you can fit toys in with your other effects without huge expense then anything you can bring that will keep them entertained here is a good thing - and will save you time and effort trying to duplicate it all after you arrive. Actually your children probably won't want to spend much time on their bikes and skateboards during the hot summer months here; and depending on where you will be living; it might be difficult to find somewhere in your neighbourhood for them to ride around safely too. By the way; while you're packing; I would be tucking a big jar of vegemite into a spare corner (if your kids like it) as it is very hard to find here and the few 150gm jars I have ever seen here cost a bomb! Hope this helps.	0

The electronic items; I would definitely bring because they will be much more expensive here. Good Luck with your move.	0

We purchased a Wii here for less than it would've cost in NZ but you have to be careful that if you bring your own PS and buy disks here that they are compatible. Likewise if you buy a new PS here that it is compatible with what is sold back in NZ; Virgin sells PAL. We didn't ship anything as we didn't know how long we would be here for and only came with suitcases and paid the excess baggage charges. Looks like we may be heading out sometime this year anyway and I'm so pleased that we didn't go the full hog and ship everything over.	0

I wish we'd brought more stuff with us when we came from NZ last year; don't have any advice re kids stuff but here's what I wish I'd known. *Bring cushion covers; knick-knacks; throws; and art; the furniture selection here is dismal but even worse is trying to find the little things. Depending on your taste you may be ok but if for example you like really simple contemporary things you're out of luck. We struggled to find things like a plain shower curtain; or a plain white dinner set. definitely bring cutlery! *Don't bring Duvet covers; the duvets here are sized differently and won't fit them. You probably won't need to bring sheets either (you'll end up with a king or super king bed) *Bring books (incl kids books) there are no good bookshops here *Bring a box of bits and pieces; things like craft knife; quick-unpick; tape; tapemeasure; vivids...etc you can buy all these things here but not necc at the same shop; I bought a box of random office stuff and I'm so glad i did! *If you br.....	0

Or if it is just easier to use excess baggage? thanks.	If you have a generous shipping allowance; ship everything that matters to you and especially to your children. If you have special hobbies; ship any tools or items specific to that hobby - for example; quilters cannot buy batting in Qatar; or only rarely. Many children's toys are available very cheaply in Qatar; made in China; many break quickly or don't work properly. If you will live on a compound; a bike is a fun thing to have; but biking on the streets in Qatar is a hair-raising and life-threatening experience. Bring books. Bring anything that will make your life more homey and that will bring you comfort. Bring things you love but can leave behind or sell when leaving Qatar; knowing you can replace them back home. As Emma said; you can buy just about anything; but you may not like your choices. There is a lot of cheap - and ugly - stuff available; but quality is rare and may be priced two or three times higher than at home. On the other hand; there are European appliances which s.....	0

Go to Briscoes for super king sheets and king size single sheets. One of the most important things to get; unless you actually enjoy sleeping on a concrete slab; is a mattress topper - like a foam/latex pad to go directly on top of your matresses. I suffered for a few months before managing to find one here but it took a bit of hassle and homework first. Bring one if you can so that you have it straight away. We didn't bring a vacuum cleaner and find we don't need one; the tiled floors get swept and mopped.Lots of my daughter's dvds don;t work here - wrong zone. Our tv worked here - bring yours if want to.	0

Or if it is just easier to use excess baggage? thanks.	we are constantly having to order and ship things over from NZ; the UK; the US as they are not available here. We end up paying way too much in shipping charges but you just cannot get the products here of the appropriate quality and any time you are looking for something specific you can never find it as the choice is extremely limited. Just recently it was toddler car seats and only today we have ordered a wooden playpen online from NZ to ship here as we cannot find a lightweight one in Qatar. We are constantly getting our family to buy and send us baby products from NZ which we cannot get here. So definitely bring whatever you can including medicines; homeopathic remedies if you use them (as they are not available at all here); skin care treatments etc. You can always sell old toys/things once the kids grow out of them or before you leave again - particularly if they are good quality items!	0

I do recommend having a cover for it else the dust and grit will quickly work its charm. You can change the hoses and connections fairly easily once you arrive. The canisters are larger in Doha than they are in the U.S.; so don't count on the tank fitting under your grill.	0

Moreover; as per my conversation with one of the Managers in DHL (who is also my friend) told me; the pressure is much less due to lack of business in recessions..so; this makes me sure that their service will be better & faster as none of your things would be queued or neglected.	1

You will need to decide if it's wiser to spend the extra on shipping or perhaps buy locally. Aramex are a cost effective shipper from the states and the UK. When you join their Shop & Ship service they give you a postal address in the USA and UK. You have you items delivered to that address; and then they forward your goods to a depot here at reasonable rates. I don't think selling items on eBay is a viable option from Qatar. But somebody else may think otherwise.	0

Ebay is good.. two things. mind where you are buying the stuff from. if you are buying from china or Hongkong; then the seller would ship the item to Qatar with HK post which is cheap and most of the times he offers it free; but the wait time is minimum one month and 45 days is normal. you can opt to get it by HK registered post too with additional shipping cost ranging from $4 to $20; which is much faster and secure. if you are buying from other countries like US; the standard shipping is done with USPS which is no better than HK post; its take a month too; alternatively if you opt to get it shipped with UPS/DHL/FedEx from the buyer; then price for shipping ranges anywhere from $140. alternatively to buy from the US seller is Easyshop by DHL; or shop n ship by Aramex. check their website to know how they work.	0

I'm going to teach Technology. The Principal (Lyal) was the principal who employed me here! Apparently the compound is good; the place to be if you have kids. Been doing as much research as I can; been comparing prices in the supermarkets there and here and am pleased to find it is much cheaper there. Andy	0

We will be going with our two young kids (2 years and 5 months) Thats good to hear that food is cheaper there. Anything else interesting you have read? How long have you been in NZ? Enjoyed it?

Or if it is just easier to use excess baggage? thanks.	Hi Mel; I guess most of the stuff that I have learned so far about AKIS and Qatar is probably the same as you. Actually finding out stuff seems difficult compared to most things on the internet. Lots of stuff seems to be out of date and this forum seems mostly full of people that struggle to put a sentence together (for whatever reason). We have found NZ to be an interesting experience but we miss our family and friends and financially we have been worse off. Food is especially expensive here; so it is good to find it cheaper there. I have been told that because the restaurants in the community are subsidised you can eat well for a couple of dollars! The school seems to have the same 'politics' issues of any school; so I guess it all depends on who you end up being mates with as to how bearable it is.

Did you read the forum from last year of the bunch of teachers leaving from the UK? I found that quite interesting. Do you have any kids? Will your wife be working too? Do you know what the child care options are? My husband was born in Ireland but grew up in Coventry and has been here for 4 years. We have been talking for ages about working overseas and thought we would just give it a go and see if anything came up. The Middle East sounded good from a tax free point of view and also because it was only one flight away from the UK. We plan to visit our relatives there quite often. Mel :)	0

Or if it is just easier to use excess baggage? thanks.	Hi Mel; yes I saw that posting about the teachers all heading out on the same flight. I imagine there are just as many this year but I guess they haven't found this thread/found this website/want to remain anonymous! We have 2 kids; both boys (13 & 9); we haven't told them yet; that is a job for this holiday. Not quite sure what their reaction will be but I am sure they will be pleased to be closer to their family. We have booked flights to the UK at the end of July and will be spending 5 weeks there before getting the plane to Doha. Gill is trained as a junior teacher but hasn't done that for a while. I think she is hoping to get something in the school once we get there; I'm sure it makes more financial sense for them to employ people who are already there; we'll see. The guy I know there who is head of Geography says that because his wife is also teaching there they have found child care quite tough and have struggled with getting the home/work balance right. So I think it will make.....	0

Yes; running could be interesting. Might just have to settle for the treadmill in the gym for most of the year. What did you mean that your friends have found child care tough? That is my only concern about the move over there; that the kids are going to be ok. I know there is the AKIS Nursery; would you mind asking your friend about child care for under 2 years?

The answer is yes; just a few months back Qatar was visited by these dust storms from the north; ofcourse they weren't Red but it lasted for about 4-5 days; in this part of the world these (dust storms) are referred to as Al-Shamaal (pardon the spelling) Usually this happens in Qatar right after i was my car; i really don't know why....it breaks my heart!	0

The graphic card is a plus but not mandatory since i5 second generation has a pretty good integrated graphics (basically the better the CPU the better the graphics performance). So at this time i would recommend: Dell inspiron 15r: i5 SG; 500GB; 4 GB RAM; GT525M - 1GB graphic memory - this was bought by a friend of mine from sofitel with 2300QR. Something cheaper than that: Acer has some laptops that are very cheap but give very good performance.
